GG: hahahaha no theyre right here!
GG: they cost a fortune
GG: yeah ive got that too!
GG: i will deploy it

GG: when john connects with me he will probably get some cool new things too!
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=003411
GG: i suppose just hang on to them for a while........
GG: and then later

[GG]
GG: yay thank you john!!!!! :D

GG: john thats ok really! im sure will get to me exactly when it needs to and it will be a nice surprise when it does!
GG: <3......

GG: its so childish
GG: D:
GG: i dont know what youre talking about at all.....
GG: its another prank
GG: no
GG: you mean the robot you think is stupid?
GG: the one youve mocked me for having on a number of occasions???
GG: this is the worst prank youve ever pulled!!!!!!
GG: why should i do that?
[GG]
GG: ok im back sorry
GG: i had to tell someone to go away!
GG: yup :o
GG: ive never had any sort of feeling about them or what they want which is kind of weird!!!
GG: but it seems to me like they are probably all different people and not one guy
GG: i have counted twelve

http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=003463
GG: dave here punch this code!
GG: L229BxoG
GG: and then put it in the jumper shunty thing and see what it does
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=003464
GG: well i think this is only one way to consolidate all the gizmo features....
GG: hang on ill give you more codes!!!
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=003527
GG: hehehe......
GG: yeah i bet hes right!
GG: wow no i dont think so...
GG: hes being a bit more literal than that!
GG: what did he say?
GG: :)
GG: well what he meant was.....
GG: that you have a dream self
GG: who is supposed to wake up whenever your real self goes to sleep
GG: we all do! all four of us i mean
GG: but see your dream self still stays asleep when you go to sleep
GG: because you havent woken up yet!
GG: yes
GG: no you would not be out of line!
GG: in fact im asleep now
GG: :p
GG: no only i can do that!
GG: because of my robot
GG: you guys can probably make your own i guess......
GG: but you need to wake up first for it to matter and maybe by the time that happens you might not even need them!!!
GG: um.......
GG: ok well i dont really know how to answer the second part but yeah shes dreaming!
GG: shes most likely lying in your bed troubled and restless
GG: about things burdening her
GG: which is to say you!!!!!
GG: things about who you really are and what your purpose is
GG: but you cant start figuring those things out yet because youre not awake because youre not ready yet
GG: thats why you have such terrible dreams all the time rose!
GG: im sure it would help to start piecing together the clues to nudge your subconscious
GG: or maybe face some things you havent faced yet?
GG: i dunno! its for you to find out
GG: maybe the stuff you wrote on your walls can give you a clue?
GG: the....
GG: er
GG: didnt dave tell you?
GG: ._.
GG: he said he was going to tell you <_<;
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=003529
GG: yeah hes pretty tied up right now!
GG: noooooooooooooooooooo
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=003530
GG: he made me promise not to bug him while im asleep!
GG: but he will find a way to be clever and make me punch myself in the face again :(
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=003553

GG: ummmmmm.....
GG: oh! yes it appears so!!!
GG: i guess! ive been pretty busy here
GG: ive had to stay asleep for a long time because john is supposed to wake up soon
GG: but he just wont wake up!!!!!
GG: im pretty sure im supposed to be the one to wake him but i dont know what to do :(
GG: huh??
GG: oh......
GG: well thanks for trying anyway!
GG: i hope so!
GG: what am i doing when i wake up?
GG: oh no!!!!!
GG: yes i know what you mean....
GG: that sounds like it would be fun!
GG: but you guys never even played pranks on me, you were always just kinda mean D:
GG: well i know i havent trolled you guys!
GG: or not yet.........
GG: heheheh
GG: oh yeah!
GG: i totally forgot about that
GG: does it really blow up or was that another trick?
GG: hmmmmm
GG: you could ask me in the future!
GG: is he not a nice guy?
GG: hmmm....
GG: well maybe hes just been through some tough times
GG: maybe we should give him the benefit of the doubt?
GG: for whatever its worth i think youre a pretty nice guy too!
GG: also you seem to be the only one who ever thinks to talk to me while im asleep!
GG: why is that?
GG: oh no!!!
GG: dream selves can die?
GG: i never knew that
GG: or even thought about it....
GG: i guess it makes sense though
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=003857
dear john,


happy birthday!!!!!!! :D


even though its super late and you probably went through a lot of trouble to get it, i really hope this present cheers you up! you looked so sad while you were reading my letter. um... which is to say, the one you are reading now. i can explain!!!


you see, when i go to sleep, in my dreams i wake up on the moon of a planet called prospit. by now you must know about this place! i have lived there in my dreams most of my life and i made so many friends there over the years. and you were there too! but you were asleep. the fact that you are awake now i think means all my friends are in trouble. you are awake because it is your job to help them. we will both help them!


but ummm..... i know these things because while i was on the moon, whenever it passed through skaia i could see lots of things in the clouds. the past, the future, stuff about our friends, and stuff about you! now that you are awake, and apparently at the center of skaia (??? WOW!!!) you should be able to see stuff in the clouds too. maybe you already have!


about this present! my penpal helped me work on it. he included a letter too! hes really funny and silly, i like him a lot and i think you would too. it took a long time between the two of us. and sure the present looks like a fun and completely ridiculous thing to get, but it is also really important! you are getting it exactly when you need it most. maybe thats hard to believe but its true! i saw it happen already. i dont see everything john, and i definitely dont know everything thats going to happen. but when i do know something, i always try to do my best to help people in the future! when im supposed to that is. youll get the hang of it.


john i am REALLY looking forward to seeing you when you wake up!!!!! its been nice playing with my prospitian friends and all, but also kind of lonely knowing you were in the other tower sleeping and having lousy dreams. :( im not sure where i am when you are reading this but im sure ill make it down to where you are soon! (jeez how did you get down there??? oh well ill find out) i cant wait to fly around the moon with you and show you all my favorite places. itll be so much fun!!!!!!!!! :D

GG: what about the -E thing, can you stop that too? it is also annoying and stupid
GG: meh :\
GG: hehehe
GG: ok, sorry for sounding bossy
GG: you seem pretty nice, and you sure do look exotic
GG: i kind of always thought you were all like
GG: a bunch of really obnoxious humans

GG: do you know what happened?
GG: fffffff
GG: yeah, i gathered that! XC

GG: and still sort of dont :\
GG: but you must mean bec
GG: also it was shortly before your friend sent me a weird message
GG: about how my robot was going to explode, and i should talk to him when it happens
GG: this was months ago
GG: it was the most awful and angry one
GG: i am so sick of him, i really dont want to talk to that pathetic jerk ever
GG: thats his name?
GG: hmmmm
GG: thats right, it was about some kind of plan...
GG: which he said me from the future told him about?
GG: i thought it was total nonsense at the time
GG: but
GG: i guess he was telling the truth
GG: so maybe i should talk to him? i dont know
GG: ewwwww
GG: ewwwwwwwwwwww!
GG: fish aliens are weird
GG: ok feferi, it was nice talking to you

[GG]
GG: ok, my robot exploded
GG: now what smart guy!
GG: i knew i would regret this
GG: talking to you is so terrible
GG: its making my headache worse
GG: uuuugh shut uuuuup!
GG: will you just tell me what you wanted?
GG: i cant believe i fell for this
GG: it was just a setup to troll me some more
GG: why do you go to such lengths to troll me? i just dont understand it
GG: thats ridiculous, humanning isnt a word
GG: and if it was, it would be a nicer thing to do than trolling!
GG: you know what i mean, stop pretending you dont
GG: aaaaaaa that is something a troll would say!
GG: i mean you are being patronizing and disingenuous to get a rise out of me
GG: and that is really really shitty!!!!!!
GG: i am so tired of it, and i am done talking to you forever
GG: bye karkat, it was awful knowing you!
GG: yes
GG: as if my day needed another reason to get worse
GG: what does that mean!
GG: is this another prank

?GG: oh jeez, why am i doing this
?GG: this is so stupid!
?GG: bluhhh youre so funny!!!!!
?GG: are you enjoying yourself karkat?
?GG: well obviously i know some things youve said are true
?GG: its just hard to take everything at face value when youre always so nasty!
?GG: ok i understand that you are another group of players and you are in some sort of trouble
?GG: but maybe if you had been nice to me instead of terrorizing me all those years i would have believed you
?GG: and we could have worked together to solve your problems as well as ours
?GG: it just makes me sad to think thats probably impossible now because you are so angry and stubborn!
?GG: uh huh
?GG: sure karkat, whatever you say!
?GG: aaauugh what the hell!!!
?GG: i cant take this anymore!!!!!!!!
?GG: i dont even know what im reading here but its preposterous and ive had it!
?GG: i am just so angry, i cant believe i let you push me around all those years
?GG: you are completely out of your mind, i was too nice by just blocking you and typing frowny faces and stuff
?GG: i should have let you HAVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
?GG: SHUT UP!!!!!!!
?GG: future karkat, if you really are future karkat......
?GG: where do you get off thinking you can just suddenly act like were pals because you said you apologized????
?GG: if you want to apologize then great i am all ears! but just mentioning it off hand and then yelling at yourself the same way you yell at me all the time as if i need a knight to come save me from yourself is so lame, not to mention completely insane
?GG: i cant even believe the things im typing here! this is so stupid, talking to two of you at once is the worst thing imaginable
?GG: you treat everyone horribly, even yourself, i cant even fathom how awful it is to be you
?GG: past karkat, youre acting like a bigger jerk than he is and i think you know that! why dont you take his advice and grow up
?GG: as if theres even a real difference between you two. three hours is hardly any time at all, you are the same person YOU FUCKING IDIOTS!!!!!!!!!
?GG: stop it!!!!
?GG: ugh, i dont know whats worse, jerk karkat or goofy sycophant karkat
?GG: i cant stand it, whether youre trying to be nice or just being a crazy asshole, you are just so weird!!!
?GG: im through humoring you, i dont even care about this stupid exploded robot mission, whatever that was
?GG: hahaha, FAT CHANCE!!!!
?GG: dave wait dont go!
?GG: youve got to save me from this insanity :(
?GG: i cant wait for future you to future kiss my ass!
?GG: i also cant wait for past you to past drop dead and go to hell, PAST TENSE!!!!!!!!
?GG: when are those things going to happen?? or will have already past/future happened?????
?GG: i want to put another reminder on my finger so i know when its time to throw a party!!!!

GG: john are you there???
GG: yes!
GG: im so relieved to talk to you and hear youre ok
GG: i mean.......
GG: are you ok john? your dream self i mean
GG: :(
GG: yes, but that was not prospit. that was its moon which was severed by the crazy derse agent
GG: i dunno!
GG: really?? :D
GG: <3
GG: i dont know! i did not give him one after applying the upgrades
GG: i gave her a girls name when i was very young, but now she is a different bunny, and also a boy i guess?
GG: its up to you john, he is your bunny
GG: hahahaha
GG: again?
GG: you were at roses house??
GG: what!!!!
GG: ugh he is so weird
GG: you shouldnt listen to him!
GG: D:
GG: he is angry and a huge pain in the ass
GG: have you ever talked to two of him at once????
GG: dont ever do it! you will get a headache
GG: noooooooo, think again
GG: ????
GG: :|
GG: you mean from armageddon?
GG: john that is so stupid
GG: but also kind of cute i guess
GG: ok then the bunny will be named after your silly movie star fantasy crush
GG: yeah......
GG: that reminds me john
GG: have you looked in the lab yet?
GG: the big room in the sphere at the top of the tower
GG: could you do me a favor and not look in there?
GG: its nothing that secret or personal or anything....
GG: it is just something kind of sad and weird for you to see
GG: it is my dead dream self
GG: it has been there for years, i always knew i would die but i did not realize it would go like this....
GG: what?
GG: oh no!!!!!
GG: im sorry john :(
GG: i understand
GG: ummmmmmm
GG: i think i would rather not talk about that either
GG: you did????
GG: oh nooooooo
GG: john that ring is really important, it belongs to the white queen!
GG: when you go to sleep again, you should try to find it and keep it safe!
GG: yes i have seen it, it is so huge ._.
GG: how much time do you suppose we have?
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004780
GG: hmmmm i wonder what the significance of that number is
GG: but they usually do!
GG: yes, youre right
GG: i dont know...
GG: there are so many possibilities
GG: hmmmmmm!
GG: yes, it sure seems that way
GG: well
GG: maybe you will get that chance john
GG: yes, as a matter of fact i am sure we will both get that chance!
GG: i once dreamt that we would
GG: sure, why not!
GG: that is what i believe this game is for in part
GG: you got to bring back your nanna, rose brought back her cat, i can bring back grandpa, and dave...
GG: dave got to bring back a dead bird because of course he is too cool to have any dead family members
GG: wait, he did????
GG: that is
GG: soooo cooooool :O
GG: i almost completely forgot i was his server player!!!!!
GG: i hope hes not in trouble, i should check on him
GG: we probably have so much to catch up on
GG: i dont see him in his house either :(
GG: oh, ok...
GG: jeez, i feel so out of the loop :(
GG: yes! ok here i go
GG: what!
GG: augh, nooooooooooooooo
GG: oh god, dont get me started :|
GG: he was a strange and silly man
GG: hmmmmmmm, perhaps
GG: is that allowed?
GG: yes, thats a good idea
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004787
GG: it is some sort of terrible creature my grandpa hunted
GG: he called it the typheus minion
GG: i always hated it!
GG: i guess so
GG: it is probably a coincidence though
GG: yeah maybe.....
GG: i guess it would make sense for someone to name a really awful web browser after such a hideous monster
GG: well sorry, i just found it sort of a weird and creepy thing to grow up with!
GG: :p!!!!!!
GG: joooohhhhhn, it is so crappy
GG: YEAH RIGHT
GG: now is obviously not the best time to have the argument about whose browser is better....
GG: but really john you should upgrade to echidna, its so much nicer
GG: after you upgrade your clunky old computer of course :P
GG: maybe when i am in the game, i can give you one of mine!
GG: oh???
GG: :O
GG: omg
GG: john that is incredible
GG: i cant wait to make stuff like that!!!!!!
GG: except...
GG: all my awesome stuff exploded with my room :(
GG: yay!!!
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004790
GG: what is the problem!!!!
GG: yes
GG: nice!
GG: how much time?
GG: D:
GG: john, try to be more careful!
GG: um.....
GG: what?
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004807
[GG]
GG: dave!
GG: are you busy?
GG: i dont have much time!
GG: i am about to make my entry item, and its a little confusing
GG: i think the more players we add, the trickier they are to... um......
GG: activate!
GG: like yours was
GG: i figured we could brainstorm about it, while john fusses with the kernel
GG: helloooooo?
GG: :o
GG: :\
GG: whaaat....?
GG: dammit dave!!!!!!
GG: this is really urgent!
GG: ._.

GG: i just had a major case of deja vu!
GG: i felt like we already had this conversation

GG: it still sort of feels that way
GG: its not going away :o
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004892
GG: ummm
GG: what do you mean i never explained it to you?
GG: if this really is the first time we talked, why would i have?
GG: XO
GG: feferi that one was a stretch even by your fish punnery standards
GG: aaah why do i know that you like to make fish puns???
GG: actually
GG: i do remember this conversation
GG: it was in the past!
GG: but if it was in the past, then where am i now?
GG: so what is going on?
GG: i dont think i am asleep....
GG: i am not on prospit
GG: oh...
GG: vaguely

GG: lava is NOT better than snow :|
GG: you cant play in lava, its no fun
GG: you can only die in lava
GG: eww dave no
GG: no this is so lame

GG: heheheh
GG: why dont we play in the snow later
GG: as soon as you get some....................................
GG: ..............................
GG: ...................

GG: all that stuff blew up
GG: its a long story that involves a pinata and a gun and a very naughty doggie
GG: so anyway, that reminds me ive got to talk to john!
GG: ive got to get him to make me some new gizmos...
GG: assuming thats even possible
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004925

GG: what does this thing do?
GG: on the back of cards?
GG: but
GG: we can already read those!
GG: hmm

GG: and not robots???
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004927
GG: anti spam?
GG: yeah obviously!
GG: oh nooo

GG: but...
GG: you are already roses server player!
GG: and john is mine!
GG: not to mention im yours!!!
GG: can you really be a server player to your own server player?
GG: but i guess
GG: i thought that john sort of.....
GG: HAD to be my server? you know?
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004929
GG: well youre from the future right?
GG: dont you know already if itll work?

[GG]
GG: oh hi!
GG: i remember you, you talked to me a lot in my dreams
GG: yup!
GG: thats because my dream self died
GG: pretty catastrophically!
GG: thanks, but i think im ok
GG: i felt pretty shaken up at first though
GG: yeah i have done a lot of sleeping myself :)
GG: wow why did you sleep so much???
GG: oh no what happened that was so terrible?
GG: ok sorry for prying!
GG: what did you want to talk about?
GG: permission for what?
GG: with bec?
GG: uh....
GG: what do you mean by commune?
GG: and
GG: what do you mean the first time!
GG: you did it before?
GG: ohhh
GG: like a psychic power??
GG: pretty sweet!
GG: when did you do it before?
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004951
GG: hehe what?
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004955
GG: omg......
GG: that wasnt a senior interloper, im pretty sure youre talking about my grandpa!!!
GG: and if im interpreting correctly....
GG: youre saying you used bec to make me shoot him???
GG: augh thats so awful!
GG: oh boy
GG: ok it is basically an old man, who serves the same role as i guess a lusus does on your planet?
GG: he was like my dad, he took care of me!
GG: sigh...
GG: well im not blaming you or anything
GG: it sounds like you were just trying to help
GG: and you did save my life
GG: but......
GG: i mean jeeeez
GG: talk about a misunderstanding
GG: uh
GG: sure?
GG: .... it is?
GG: oh nooo
GG: how did that happen?
GG: :|
GG: ummm what kind of device?
GG: oh you mean a wheelchair!
GG: how...
GG: did that happen?
GG: D:
GG: im so sorry
GG: um also
GG: i didnt realize you were paralyzed
GG: not that im saying sorry for that! that would be rude i think
GG: i am just saying sorry for your loss
GG: oh?
GG: wow nice!
GG: um
GG: that.....
GG: i dont know if i agree with that!
GG: well
GG: thats good i guess
GG: i just wish...
GG: maybe you'd told me what happened when i was younger?
GG: i spent years wondering about it!
GG: when i was REALLY young, i was sure the doll sitting across from him did it
GG: and for a long time i was terrified of the evil blue girl!!!
GG: she sort of haunted my childhood and i had trouble sleeping for a long time
GG: but of course i got older and realized that was silly, but then i just speculated that maybe it was suicide
GG: which was just a really sad thing to think about!!!
GG: buuuut...
GG: even if you do, i dont remember you doing so!
GG: er
GG: ok :\
GG: .......
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004956
GG: woooooow...
GG: you sound really confused to me!
GG: heheheh
GG: youre incredibly silly
GG: i cant really tell to what extent youre joking around here!
GG: rufio?
GG: what do you mean fake?
GG: ohh like an imaginary friend....
GG: heh, ok
GG: that
GG: sure is a philosophy you have there!
GG: oh??
GG: well, what is it?
GG: yes
GG: sure!
GG: red feelings?
GG: you mean
GG: whoooooaaaaaa
GG: wait
GG: really? :o
GG: um.................
GG: well
GG: i dont think i can reciprocate!
GG: i mean
GG: youre nice
GG: but i dont really know you...
GG: i dont even know your name!
GG: ok tavros
GG: i dont know if youve fully thought about this!
GG: you dont actually know me very well either
GG: well no
GG: i was being nice
GG: because
GG: i like to be nice to people when i can, and when they are nice to me
GG: but......
GG: things are a little more complicated than that, you cant know someone just by a few conversations!
GG: i mean, i only talked to you when i was asleep! i am kind of different when im dreaming...
GG: i forget things, and at times im not totally sure whats real
GG: dont you remember thats what its like to dream on prospit?
GG: sorry, i feel bad about having to disappoint you...
GG: but i dont know what else to say
GG: jeeeeeez, um...
GG: tavros i am really flattered you like me and all
GG: and that sure is confident of you to say so! and thats great buuuut...
GG: i guess confidence is one thing but there is such a thing as being toooo forward i guess?
GG: i aaaalso think...
GG: and really this is just polite friendly advice!
GG: that if youre really confident you dont always have to say it all the time
GG: it...
GG: oh man im sorry to say
GG: it just comes of as a little insecure and off putting and kind of defeats the purpose!
GG: and all things considered i think we should just stay friends
GG: or really........
GG: continue building a friendship in the first place, since like i said we dont actually know each other that well!
GG: sorry :C
GG: aaaah no! you should have self respect
GG: just...
GG: oh boy this is frustrating
GG: can we talk about this later?
GG: i have some things to do!
GG: why dont we get back to the original point
GG: why do you want to commune with bec again?
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004957
GG: uh-ohhh
GG: what is your idea this time?
GG: wow, i dunno about that!
GG: but hes my best friend!!!
GG: and you have already managed to get one of my family members killed
GG: but all of our adversaries have inherited his powers!
GG: i would imagine the strongest guy would have all of his powers, and then some!!!
GG: i am really not comfortable with this
GG: you said you are asking me permission first and i appreciate that
GG: but if you are asking im afraid my answer is no!
GG: what?
GG: no way!
GG: that would be smug and arrogant and would make you a bully!!!
GG: later if my friends and i want to ask bec for help and decide thats our best hope, then thats our business
GG: until then, just please stop meddling!!!!!!
GG: nooooooooo dont dont dont dont dont
GG: im serious
GG: uuuuggghh i think my headache is coming back
GG: no...
GG: its fine
GG: i just really dont want you to do that ok?
GG: i have to go now
GG: bye tavros
[GG]
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005041
GG: it is the prettiest tree i have ever seen!!!!!
GG: ok great!
GG: everything about that makes total sense
GG: ok
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005042
GG: is this conksucky enough
GG: <3
GG: well...
GG: i am not even sure if i am technically a u.s. citizen!
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005075
[GG]
GG: which one were you again?
GG: wait
GG: werent you the guy who was always trying to hit on me??
GG: uh...
GG: but
GG: im the wwitch!
GG: i mean witch
GG: rose?
GG: i do not have a score to settle with rose!!!
GG: why would you think that?
GG: i think you are projecting your own attitude on to others
GG: just because you tend to hate and/or hit on everyone you meet doesnt mean everyone else is that way
GG: rose just sent me a code for a crystal ball, shes my friend and is basically the best!
GG: wait do you have a thing for her too???
GG: did she reject you or something?
GG: :|
GG: uh huh...
GG: wow what are you talking about
GG: hey look at that, time for me to get going!
GG: no i dont want it!!!!!
GG: more like a legendary piece of shit!
GG: yes but i dont like you very much and i feel really icky about accepting a present from you
GG: siiigh
GG: fine
GG: what?
GG: oh...
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005076
GG: hmmm...
GG: i have seen this before
GG: i am very sure its the same rifle included with johns present
GG: but...
GG: bigger of course
GG: yes but....
GG: i did not provide the weapons!
GG: my penpal did
GG: the guy who helps me build the present
GG: we worked on it together but he supplied the bunnys weapons
GG: im pretty sure hes from the future!
GG: because he said hes my grandson
GG: umm yes
GG: oh no!!!!!
GG: aaaaa please dont tell anyone i told you about him!
GG: augh how could i let that slip to you of all people
GG: wow ok!!!!
GG: i wasnt going to say anything
GG: he didnt want me to tell my friends who he really was
GG: i guess maybe he was concerned about upsetting the timeline? i dunno
GG: maybe!
GG: i have wondered about that, assuming he is right...
GG: he was so nice, and it really did feel like i was talking to family, so i really dont think he was making it up
GG: i couldnt help but try to imagine his parents...
GG: and more interestingly.......
GG: his grandfather :O
GG: i still wonder who it could be...
GG: although i guess at this point
GG: the options are pretty limited :o
GG: like an heirloom? i guess it could be
GG: do you even have those? if you dont have parents how could you?
GG: ewwwwwwww
GG: hmmmm
GG: then maybe that is how this heirloom should work
GG: well i dont want to use it!
GG: so ill just dump it outside the house with the trash
GG: and if it is fated to find my penpal one day then so be it!
GG: maybe you should have been nicer to me!
GG: in any case i dont appreciate the spirit in which the gift was given so this is what i will do!

GG: if that was a future dave you have to make sure that doesnt happen!!!
GG: oh
GG: i am confused :o
GG: ok...
GG: i am still not sure i get that!
GG: but i guess i am relieved?
GG: wheeeew! there i just was
GG: how did that poor dave die?
GG: was it jack?
GG: D:
GG: what about your...
GG: um....
GG: oh no i dont even know if you know about this
GG: ;_;
GG: is it something you would like to talk about
GG: ghost dad???
GG: oh...
GG: yes he mentioned something about it
GG: i guess i didnt realize its full implications....
GG: but time was short when we talked!
GG: ugh i forgot i still have to get back to him
GG: its like a big unpleasant chore hanging over my head D:
GG: anyway dave im really sorry about your bro/dad
GG: you were pretty close with him right?
GG: heheh
GG: sure
GG: dave we have to stop him!!!!!
GG: jack!
GG: he shouldnt get away with this
GG: yes
GG: why dont you stop jumping around through time like a maniac and stop being like a hundred daves all the time and come to my house so we can make a plan to kill him??
GG: oh :(
GG: what is the scratch?
GG: really??
GG: hmmmm...
GG: so was that like a hint?
GG: about what im supposed to do :D
GG: well maybe im just being naive...
GG: but a crazy suicide mission does not sound like the ideal solution to me!
GG: are you suuuure we cant beat him?
GG: i dont know if we should rule it out!
GG: ok
GG: thanks dave!

JADE: i prototyped you and brought you back!
JADE: should i not have?
JADE: oh no, it is?
JADE: :(
JADE: thats terrible, im really sorry
JADE: i guess i did not think this through
JADE: i dont think...
JADE: that it can be undone :(
JADE: :o
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005142
JADE: well...
JADE: now i dont know what to do
JADE: i really messed up, i feel so bad
JADE: where would you go?
JADE: but you cant!
JADE: i mean, not just yet, please?
JADE: i know you are upset jade
JADE: but i did sort of bring you back for a reason
JADE: we need your help!
JADE: well, all of us here
JADE: me and dave and rose and john
JADE: D:
JADE: what is it now!
JADE: what do you mean, how could you forget about john???
JADE: but john didnt die!
JADE: i saved him
JADE: YOU saved him, dont you remember?
JADE: you pushed him out of the way of prospits moon at the last minute, and hes ok now!!!
JADE: oh nooo jade please dont
JADE: :C
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005143
JADE: :(
JADE: i know jade i was there too...
JADE: these are both our memories!
JADE: jade, pleeease...
JADE: stop...
JADE: you are going to make me cry too, stop it!!!
JADE: *sob*
JADE: PFFheheh... *sob* hehehehehehe
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005144
JADE: you want me to help you...
JADE: die again?
JADE: wow...
JADE: ok, i know this is my fault
JADE: but that is a really hard thing to ask me to do!
JADE: even if it was possible the way you are now
JADE: i dont think i could go through with it :(
JADE: ok ok shhhhh...
JADE: jade listen
JADE: i never did tell you why i brought you back
JADE: and it may be that
JADE: if you attempt what i wanted you to do in the first place
JADE: god i cant believe im saying this...
JADE: but you might end up getting what you want anyway
JADE: because it was always going to be risky
JADE: well, you remember the guy who destroyed prospit?
JADE: shh!!!
JADE: anyway, he is the reason i brought you here
JADE: he has the same powers you have, making him unbeatable to us...
JADE: but maybe not you!
JADE: so you could go find him and
JADE: um
JADE: i just thought
JADE: as long as youre here
JADE: but
JADE: i thought you wanted to die?
JADE: you wouldnt go even if he could...
JADE: jeez...
JADE: youre right, i really dont
JADE: i said SHH!
JADE: wow
JADE: jade...
JADE: i dont mean to be insensitive but
JADE: there is a lot at stake here!
JADE: i... pfhehe, dont change the subject!
JADE: i mean, dont you remember what this was all about?
JADE: what you were working for... what WE were working for all those years before you died?
JADE: remember what we saw in the clouds, or what the queen told us?
JADE: how could you not remember john survived?
JADE: we both saw him in a cloud! he was in his dream suit and awake, reading our letter!
JADE: didnt you think about that?
JADE: ...
JADE: what!!!!!
JADE: how can you SAY that?
JADE: JOHN DIDNT DIE!!!
JADE: omg...
JADE: this is so frustrating, i just told you he didnt
JADE: i knew i was kind of ditzy and forgetful in my dreams, but
JADE: SHHHHH! okaaaaaay, jeez!
JADE: i just dont know what to think
JADE: i guess you are part of me, and you are who i was when i slept
JADE: but it makes me sad to think i would act like this
JADE: i would like to think that even if i was sad and scared, if i was put in a position where everyone depended on me, i could put all those feelings aside and do whats right!
JADE: yes you do!
JADE: even though you dont want to be, youre here now, and there are still people who need you
JADE: there is still something worth fighting for!
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005145
JADE: that is a horrible thing to say!
JADE: AUGH!
JADE: that is SO SELFISH!!!
JADE: i cant believe this
JADE: how can you say these things, dont you remember anything that the queen told us?
JADE: that we would eventually build a new world and make a future together with our friends?
JADE: dont you remember being excited about finding out what that meant?
JADE: yes it will!!!
JADE: some of us, the ones who still have hope, are fighting for that RIGHT NOW
JADE: how can you have such a negative outlook on absolutely everything?
JADE: shut up!!!!!!
JADE: stop being such a damn crybaby!
JADE: really, we both had the EXACT SAME EXPERIENCES. and look, i am managing to keep my head up, see?
JADE: you dont even have the full picture either, because you checked out early!
JADE: you didnt have to stand by as bec gave jack his powers when you might have been able to stop that
JADE: and you didnt have to watch as jack became so strong he could appear anywhere and kill anyone you loved at any moment!
JADE: you didnt have to see a dave lying in his own blood :(
JADE: no, see...
JADE: HEY! no. youre not allowed to cry about that because you DIDNT SEE IT
JADE: thats the whole point!!!
JADE: you are just looking for any excuse you can to be sad and useless and its starting to piss me off!
JADE: no
JADE: NO. BAD.
JADE: NO, FOR GODS SAKE WILL YOU SHUT UP AND PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER, YOU ARE DRIVING ME CRAZY
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005146
JADE: I SAID PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER YOU BLUBBERING GODDAMN PANSY
JADE: JUST SHUT UP. DRY YOUR CRYBABY EYES, STOP BEING A COWARD, AND GO FIGHT JACK NOIR!!!!!!!!!!!!
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005147

[GG]
GG: karkat!!!!!
GG: yes
GG: im going crazy here
GG: i never thought id say this, but im actually almost relieved to talk to you
GG: or really ANYBODY besides that lunatic
GG: SHE IS DRIVING ME NUTS!!!!!!!
GG: are you joking??? look at this mess!
GG: okay...
GG: i made the mistake of prototyping my dream self who has been dead for years
GG: and shes completely crazy and theres no talking any sense into her
GG: hmm?
GG: hmm what
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005151
GG: :\
GG: what are you getting at???
GG: well...
GG: i mean, i understand why she is upset
GG: but she is completely inconsolable, and wont listen to reason about anything!
GG: and i guess i could deal with that but...
GG: the frustrating thing is that shes actually me :(
GG: i really dont think i would act like that
GG: will you stop saying hmm!!!!!!
GG: fascination?
GG: what do you find so fascinating?
GG: my feelings?
GG: well...
GG: at first i was sad
GG: because she made me remember all the sad things that just happened
GG: but im trying to be strong about all that so we can keep moving forward
GG: and if i can then why cant she?
GG: but she just went on and on
GG: and i started getting angry...
GG: ugh i have never been so angry in my LIFE!!!
GG: I SAID STOP SAYING FUCKING HMM
GG: what does THAT mean?????
GG: is that supposed to be someone with a halo and goofy teeth?
GG: ARE YOU MAKING FUN OF ME?
GG: oh
GG: haha oops
GG: yeah, pretty much
GG: considering what??
GG: oh come on...
GG: this is NOTHING like that!
GG: because she's...
GG: well
GG: she's ACTUALLY INSANE
GG: but
GG: those are you
GG: im not her!
GG: i dont know
GG: it just...
GG: ...
GG: oh my god
GG: youre right :(
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005152
GG: so then i guess
GG: im a hypocrite :(
GG: wait...
GG: so me arguing with my dead dream self
GG: and smacking her around while screaming at her
GG: makes me SANE???
GG: hahaha, wow
GG: you are so weird
GG: you want me to apologize?!
GG: for what, calling you crazy for arguing with yourself???
GG: after taking so much crap from you for all those years?
GG: no forget it, im not apologizing that is BULLSHIT
GG: shut uuuup!!!
GG: what
GG: are you saying you want to apologize
GG: ok, i appreciate the THOUGHT of an apology, but i dont know if it really counts if you are just going to pawn off responsibility on your "past self" again!
GG: maybe your "present self" should own up to it!
GG: laaaaame
GG: hahahaha, that is so ridiculous
GG: why dont you stop it with all this nonsense and own up to being terrible unequivocally?
GG: :o
GG: hmmmm...
GG: yes, hm
GG: ok karkat, that sounds pretty sincere to me
GG: and youre right, i dont actually know you
GG: i just know the part of you who acted like a bully
GG: i understand there can be more to a person than just the stuff they say when theyre angry
GG: so i will accept your apology and give you another chance
GG: and i will apologize for calling you crazy
GG: obviously i am not in much position to judge :|
GG: so you say you have been talking to me from the future?
GG: ok, so what is the plan?
GG: i mean, why did you want me to contact you at this moment so badly?
GG: yes
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005153
GG: ok, i can do that
GG: but why, what does it do?
GG: its been here my whole life and i could never figure it out
GG: i dont think im following...
GG: you were told?
GG: by who?
GG: oh...
GG: future me?
GG: uh... ok
GG: well it sounds like a pretty good policy to me!
GG: hey!!!
GG: oh yeah! dave told me about that.
GG: what is it?
GG: ok then...
GG: what was the thing i told you to tell me to do?
GG: right now, i mean
GG: ok
GG: then what
GG: draw it?
GG: and then?
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005203
[GG]
GG: password!
GG: I SAID PASSWORD FUCKASS!!!!!
GG: whoops sorry
GG: ive been having too many password arguments with karkat i guess :p
GG: well......
GG: it depends, do you want to have a silly conversation or a serious conversation?
GG: both are!
GG: but a silly conversation mostly doesnt matter or make the timeline more confusing than it needs to be
GG: so we can have one right now if you want
GG: in fact i would say it is coming dangerously close to being one already!
GG: but if it is a serious conversation you want then im afraid i must demand a........
GG: PASSWORD :P
GG: nope!
GG: because i told you
GG: exactly!!!!!!!!!!!
GG: hehehe
GG: yum :B ??????????????????????
GG: hmm, i suppose those are acceptable
GG: to keep the conversations linear!
GG: i gave you a password at the end of our previous conversation
GG: you have to give me that password to start our next conversation
GG: this ensures that past you cant jump ahead into the conversation and mess everything up, like you are trying to do now!
GG: i know, but trust me its better this way :)
GG: i dont know, i have no idea what time you are from!
GG: but you will get it, i gave it to you some time ago at the end of our last conversation
GG: and i have been eagerly awaiting your linear and unconfusing reply ever since!
GG: bye kanaya <3
[GG]
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005205
[GG]
GG: thanks i think!
GG: what do you mean by pre blackout rose?
GG: umm, ok...
GG: but what do you mean by blackout???
GG: hmm @_@
GG: im doing what you told me to do!
GG: im getting dave to set up that expensive equipment
GG: so i can start doing all that witch of spacey stuff you were telling me about
GG: which i appreciate, since my sprite turned out to be sad and useless, and not very wise at all :(
GG: oh
GG: what is a sylph?
GG: a magical witch???
GG: thats awesome
GG: breeding duties?????
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005206
GG: uhhhhhhhhh...
GG: please tell me that doesnt involve what it sounds like!
GG: it sounds like
GG: it involves
GG: a lot of breeding :\
GG: oh
GG: does the equipment we are deploying have anything to do with it?
GG: ok then, thats pretty neat
GG: yeah, whew <_<;
GG: how so?
GG: what is your role?
GG: whoa, cool!
GG: so you are like bugs, like bees or ants or such, but with horns
GG: :o
GG: errr.......
GG: yes 8|
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005207
GG: what!
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005208
GG: you think so?
GG: i think you can do it!
GG: yes...
GG: didnt you say your lusus was a grub?
GG: thats perfect!
GG: if you were raised by a mother grub, then you are in a great position to raise one yourself
GG: it is like...
GG: a sort of family legacy!
GG: a really cool alien family legacy
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005209
GG: dont mention it!
GG: so how does this cloning stuff work?
GG: i want to try anyway!
GG: if you can hold out hope for rebuilding your race in the center of a meteor, then i think i can at least try to get a little cloning done with the time i have left
GG: yes, dave is doing that at the top of this ridiculous tower
GG: didnt you say it needed to be in a warm place?
GG: my house is freezing now
GG: it ran on geothermal power before...
GG: and i guess theres no heat anywhere inside this planet
GG: yes i would like to hear about that later...
GG: but yeah the weather seems just fine out here in the medium!
GG: lets see how dave is doing.....
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005211
GG: its...
GG: so small :o
GG: but
GG: clone babies can barely even fit on that thing!
GG: i mean young humans!!!
GG: you know, that we milk producers nurture hatchless within?
GG: then what is the objective?
GG: what am i breeding????
GG: :O
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005212
GG: i cant get over how tiny this thing is!
GG: its so cute
GG: so the baby frogs show up on this pad here?
GG: i cant wait to try it
GG: oh
GG: lol
GG: dave just has a lot of funny stuff to say about all this
GG: oh you know, a bunch of silly stuff
GG: theres too much to copy/paste!
GG: here ill save it all to a file and send it to you
[GG]
GG: hahaha
GG: alright how do i get started!
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005214
GG: ok, here is a frog on the screen
GG: on no, is it trapped in ice?
GG: was your planet covered in ice too?
GG: cool!
GG: anyway, i will try to rescue this frog
GG: so i push this button to appearify it?
GG: ok........
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005215
GG: oh god, it is still a frogcicle!!!!
GG: this will not do
GG: i dont understand!
GG: but i am intrigued...
GG: ok, that makes sense i think
GG: how can i appearify some frog slime?
GG: so it is like
GG: a sort of backwards frog breeding
GG: clone first, catch later?
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005216
GG: ok, i will try this
GG: heheh, look at this handsome guy here, hiding in the woods and being sneaky
GG: he looks frozen solid too
GG: so if i go bother him later, that means if i try to take him now i will only get slime right???
GG: that sounds like fun!!!!!!!
GG: hmmmmm
GG: k hang on while i clone this fella.....
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005217
GG: yaaaaaay!!!
GG: i will think of something...
GG: i wont let the poor little guy suffocate!
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005218
GG: so i am supposed to wait for him to grow up, and then breed him with other frog paradox clones?
GG: it is?
GG: huh...
GG: so what is the actual purpose of all this breeding?
GG: am i trying to make one really special frog with just the right genetic code or something?
GG: sort of like the ULTIMATE FROG :O
GG: oh!
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005219
GG: why?
GG: him?
GG: so he is a boy frog?
GG: the speaker?
GG: hehehe
GG: CROOOOOOAK
GG: then the speaker is like a god, but there are a lot of them?
GG: like one for each session, kind of like the kings and queens?
GG: it is pretty catchy...
GG: if i call him that i will be sure to say i mean no offense!
GG: thats good
GG: ok then what?
GG: what do we do after i make this big god froggy?
GG: does it have something to do with the new universe we create?
GG: you said he was a genesis frog
GG: does that mean we bring him into the universe and...
GG: he makes new planets or life or such?
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005220
GG: really???
GG: yes i got that!
GG: you mean he is LITERALLY a universe?
GG: but your species is too!
GG: especially karkat, he is incredibly sarcastic
GG: but i dont do that!
GG: i try to say what i mean as much as i can
GG: from what?
GG: haha, you mean from rose?
GG: yeah, rose and dave are like that all the time!
GG: they inculcate that stuff like crazy
GG: so you have been talking to her a lot i guess?
GG: are you best friends now??
GG: why?
GG: oh yeah, because you said she is blacked out?
GG: what the heck does that mean!
GG: yeah, i didnt like the sound of her plan either!
GG: you did???????
GG: yeah! :D
GG: jeez, i hope not...
GG: me too!!!!!
GG: wow kanaya i did not realize how much we had in common
GG: well, it sounds like helping people is something that is in your nature
GG: i can understand that
GG: are you saying rose is reckless and dangerous?
GG: you mean your guardian?
GG: uh oh...
GG: im not sure why, but the sound of that makes me really nervous
GG: she didnt mention anything about this when we talked
GG: but then she seemed preoccupied
GG: yeah, i will!
GG: lol yeah i guess so!
GG: ok, you can go do that, and i guess i will check on rose, but...
GG: theres still so much i want to know!
GG: i want to know more about stoking the forge and breeding the frogs, and about your time on prospit and all that!
GG: yes! <3
GG: if i have cause to?
GG: oh!!!
GG: that reminds me, i was thinking of implementing a system to keep some of these confusing conversations simple and linear
GG: yeah! i guess someone told you?
GG: aaaaa you see??????
GG: you nearly just gave me the idea for the plan in the first place paradoxically from my own future self!!!
GG: i just find that kind of thing annoying for some reason, it doesnt feel right...
GG: i would rather ideas came from the place they actually came from
GG: ok lets put the system in play starting now!
GG: i will give you a password, and you give it to me in the future when you want to pick up this conversation again
GG: the password is...............
GG: CROOOOOOOOOOOAK
GG: it must be in all caps, and must contain precisely ten Os!
GG: whoops!
GG: eleven then :p
GG: kanaya :o
GG: that sounded
GG: just a weeeeeee bit
GG: sarcastic ;D
GG: you are just becoming multicultural, thats all
GG: i think i am learning to be more multicultural through karkat as well
GG: it mostly involves saying fuck a lot
GG: heheheheh, its ok, hes really not so bad
GG: ok! go hatch that orb!
GG: i will be waiting
GG: later!
[GG]
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005315
[GG]
GG: john!!! :D
GG: wow, finally!
GG: nope!
GG: dave was able to set up as my server player
GG: he is building up my house right now so that we can deploy some equipment up there
GG: yep!
GG: :o
GG: thats ok, i wont tell him about it
GG: well, maybe you can.....
GG: i will try to put in a good word for you B)
GG: im not sure!
GG: something to do with cloning i guess? it serves some purpose in my quest as witch of space
GG: a nice troll named kanaya has been advising me on stuff about that
GG: have you talked to her?
GG: you should!
GG: a bunch of trolls are not nearly as bad as i thought
GG: even karkat! he has been helping me too... sort of, hehe
GG: oh yeah, he said plenty of stuff like that, but i dont think he ever actually meant it
GG: flying off the handle is part is of his charm in a funny way, once you know that about him
GG: heheheh
GG: shhhhhhhhh
GG: yeah!
GG: hmm what else... theres been so much going on, its been a little hard to keep track of it all!
GG: why dont you tell me what youve been up to first?
GG: ..............
GG: whoa :O
GG: john where did you get that nice flying car??????
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005316
GG: sort of!
GG: she gave me the code, and i made a cool pair of goggles with it
GG: it certainly seems so! what with your fancy magic car
GG: and your chauffeur familiar, i guess?
GG: you did???
GG: :(
GG: hmmmmm...
GG: maybe, but hang on let me try something
GG: yes!
GG: what have you seen?
GG: :O
GG: like what, what did you seeeee?
GG: frogs?
GG: no...
GG: sure does!
GG: nope! but that sounds pretty interesting
GG: i wonder why i would be surrounded by frogs?
GG: hahaha thats true!
GG: i hope i am not planning on putting them in a cauldron or anything o_o
GG: whew!
GG: bluh. yes :|
GG: i prototyped my dead dream self and tried to get her to fight jack
GG: but it turned out to be a BIG MISTAKE
GG: god i cant believe how dumb that idea was, she was an emotional wreck
GG: oh, she went off to cry somewhere else... good riddance!
GG: hehe i guess so
GG: what!!!!!
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005317
GG: oh noooo
GG: who?
GG: i dont think so!
GG: well if she tricked you into getting killed, then i would have to agree
GG: what process?
GG: and how are you alive now if you died! john im a little confused
GG: ohhhhhh!
GG: that makes sense
GG: dave had mentioned you reached the god tier
GG: but he did not say what it involved D:
GG: he probably didnt want to make me worried
GG: or that!
GG: but he also said that no one else would do it but you...
GG: actually, now it makes sense that i wouldnt be able to, since my dream self is dead
GG: its too bad really
GG: i wonder what space powers would be like??
GG: oh well
GG: !!!
GG: youre right...
GG: i suddenly dont know if i want to become a god tier anymore :(
GG: DX
GG: i dont even want to talk about her! she is sad and cowardly.
GG: why dont you tell me about your new friend?
GG: he sure seems to be enjoying that horn!
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005318
GG: haha! what is he doing with that!
GG: probably!
GG: you are just going to have to deal with the fact that you are becoming a famous hero john, and people everywhere will idolize you
GG: :o
GG: thats great! john you have to get that ring from him!
GG: hmmmmmmmmmm
GG: that is a problem!
GG: you do?
GG: and what?
GG: 8O
GG: ok john.....
GG: i trust you
GG: so i will trust in your trust in him
GG: im going to be a supportive piece of shit all day and fall down all this trust!
GG: lol
GG: john, i already found your dad!
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005319
GG: yes i found him with my goggles almost right away!
GG: but i didnt want to interrupt you
GG: he is with roses mom
GG: they are in a castle, having some sort of tea party together
GG: they appear to be enjoying each others company!
GG: its quite adorable actually
GG: RED ALERT!!!!!!
GG: AWOOOOOOOOOOOGA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
GG: durrrr oh really john :p
GG: but really, they make a nice couple and i think it would be great if they got married!
GG: i guess so
GG: yes they are pretty special
GG: i dunno
GG: who are they to stand between two youngsters in love?
GG: yes john, two people must be in love in order to get married
GG: it is one of the rules!
GG: so what do you say john, are you in love with rose?
GG: and if not, are you prepared to fall in love with her?
GG: wellllll? :D
GG: i didnt even know karkat made a shipping diagram...
GG: i will have to make him show me
GG: <_<;
GG: whaaat...
GG: i dont know about that!
GG: i clearly need to take a good hard look at this prophetic document
GG: and possibly tell karkat what an idiot he is!
GG: uh
GG: well, i dont actually know where he is relative to you!
GG: so i dont know if i can give you directions
GG: there might be some way to do that...
GG: these goggles are actually REALLY COMPLICATED!
GG: i will look into it and get back to you
GG: in the meantime, why dont you fly around and keep looking?
GG: at least now you know to look for a castle
GG: and maybe the clouds will give you some more tips!
GG: sure! <3
GG: later!
[GG]
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005492
GG: ummmmmm hey guys i hope im not interrupting!!!
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005493
GG: oh no!
GG: i can leave
GG: :o
GG: its ok! i can take another nap later when you guys arent busy...
GG: well...
GG: i have just been enjoying these little naps more and more lately!
GG: each time i go to sleep i meet more new people and learn so much
GG: but i still cant get karkat to take a nap, boy talk about a guy who is anti nap!
GG: seeeeeriously!
GG: he is the douchiest of crabby crabs who ever douched a big douchey crab
GG: but yeah, its been fun, i should really thank feferi again for setting it up so we could meet like this!
GG: yup!
GG: ummm probably in another bubble
GG: but youll find her! maybe during your next nap...
GG: yeah!
GG: you were really nice and helpful
GG: i think your outfit looks so cute! i love your wings too
GG: i am not sure :o
GG: what!
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005495
GG: i am ready!
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005496
GG: yay!
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005497
GG: wait! before we do...
GG: hi kanaya! it is nice to meet you
GG: you dont like it???
GG: yes i know you told me!
GG: yes but you probably havent yet
GG: not from your perspective..... i could not help but overhear you are asleep now
GG: you told me all about what happened after you woke up!
GG: about how you turned into a vampire
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005498
GG: isnt that daves puppet?
GG: :\
GG: bye!
GG: guys why do you have daves puppet?
GG: what is going on here!
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005536
GG: rose jeez!!!
GG: finally
GG: you sure seem to be absorbed in whatever youre doing on that computer...
GG: were you talking to someone?
GG: oh no no i dont blame you for not responding!
GG: you must be very upset
GG: are you ok?
GG: um
GG: because
GG: uhhh i figured you would have found out by now but i guess you still dont know?
GG: about...
GG: johns dad
GG: and.......
GG: your mom :(
GG: rose?
GG: hello???
GG: oh noo :'(
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005538
GG: rose please say something
GG: you are making me nervous...
GG: umm
GG: because you were busy trying to make the best of this situation?
GG: i dont think you should be so hard on yourself about it
GG: john was being john, and you were being you, which i guess meant taking our problems very seriously and putting all your attention on solving them!
GG: and anyway, you and your mom had a much trickier relationship than john and his dad didnt you?
GG: i mean, not that i am saying that means you were any less attached to her than him...
GG: argh, i dont know if im very good at consoling people. sorry rose i dont want to make you feel worse :(
GG: whew, ok
GG: you know...
GG: now we have all lost guardians
GG: dave lost his, and i lost mine in a weird way... uuum even though that was pretty much definitely my fault :\
GG: and even the trolls all lost their monster guardians
GG: i think that maybe it is an inevitable part of a game that can be cruel sometimes
GG: ......
GG: i am so sad
GG: rose i think you are being stronger about it than i am
GG: oh
GG: well
GG: i just hope you arent thinking of doing something rash
GG: yeaaah...
GG: errrr, i dont know?
GG: wellllll
GG: no!
GG: but i was trusting that you had thought it through and it was our best hope
GG: hm
GG: then what will you do?
GG: what does that mean!
GG: oh no no no no no!
GG: rose that is a much much worse plan!!!!!
GG: he would probably kill you!
GG: i know what you mean, i was angry at jack and wanted to stop him too, but we have to think of a more sensible way to do it
GG: what? who?
GG: aaaaaaa whaaaaat?????
GG: rose who is this!
GG: i dont even know whats going on anymore
GG: SHHHHHHHHHH!
GG: please dont rose, i know you are angry but you arent thinking straight
GG: nooo :(
GG: rose, maybe white text guy is right?
GG: the dark gods gave you all these powers, and seem to be helping us with dream bubbles and stuff...
GG: but what if they are not actually good?
GG: no...
GG: but i still dont trust them!
GG: whats this weirdo talking about!
GG: oh yeah
GG: i noticed you found it!
GG: i was worried it had been destroyed when my room blew up
GG: is he saying you can use it?
GG: omg
GG: does it work???
GG: then maybe you should try it!
GG: well
GG: since we dont know much about the gods...
GG: why dont you ask it about them?
GG: i guess that is a way to put it
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005589
[GG]
GG: john!!! i am worried about rose!
GG: im pretty sure she is on her way there to look for jack!
GG: i cant say for sure because i cant see her with my goggles anymore for some reason, but i am fearing the worst
GG: just in case, you should to try to intercept her before she does something stupid like try to fight him!!!!!
GG: also, um...
GG: i guess you probably still dont know about your dad yet do you?
GG: darn, why do i always have to be the one to break terrible news :(
GG: er
GG: john?
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005590
GG: oh god please dont tell me your computer was in the wallet you just gave that guy.....
GG: dammit john!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
GG: one of these days you will learn the value of having plenty of backup computers
GG: in fact whenever you finally leave the battlefield i am going to give you the code for a nice pair of lunchmuffs
GG: and then i am going to force you to keep them on your head AT ALL TIMES!
GG: yeah, youre never going to read this are you :|
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005771
shenanigans
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005872
[GG]
GG: pw.
GG: listen fuckass
GG: i am going to need a password before we continue
GG: plz <3
GG: ....................... :|
GG: no karkat, that was not quite the password
GG: but you were on the right track :p
GG: do you even remember the right password?
GG: youre being deliberately dumb
GG: it was...
GG: IF I HATE MYSELF SO MUCH, THEN WHY DON'T I HATEMARRY MYSELF?
GG: remember?
GG: i was just using the password system to poke a little fun at you, and you turn it into this whole overdramatic thing, jeeeeez.
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005873
GG: i wonder if we will ever be able to start a conversation without having a ridiculous argument about the password system?
GG: why would i want to do that??
GG: the only guy whos dumber than past karkat is future karkat, and vice versa!
GG: i have this on good authority from both sources
GG: you see, that is your problem
GG: okay, one of your many, many problems...
GG: you have no patience to do things the right way, youre always just looking for the shortcut!
GG: even if doing so has brought you nothing but trouble a hundred times before
GG: it is sort of funny that the only thing standing in your way is one of your other problems, your preposterous self loathing
GG: so you cant even trust your future self to help you cheat!
GG: its like you have so many problems, they cancel each other out
GG: exactly :D
GG: ok
GG: yes
GG: yes, we still are!
GG: this little detour was related to that task. we should be nearly done.
GG: i can understand her just fine!
GG: we already talked about this
GG: echidna and i have an understanding now ;)
GG: well maybe if you werent in such a grumpy hurry all the time you wouldnt have killed your denizen so quickly
GG: you might have actually learned something!!!!!!
GG: did you ever talk to kanaya about it?
GG: her situation was very similar to mine
GG: it doesnt sound like you got the whole story
GG: or maybe you just werent listening to her :p
GG: this was kanayas suggestion
GG: yes!
GG: im talking to her right now actually
GG: durrr, of course not, shes from a different time than you genius
GG: a few hours in your future!
GG: you are so ridiculous, i have kanaya using the same password system as you
GG: she is just a little further ahead on my timeline is all
GG: it would be pretty hard to keep you both synced up!
GG: yeah, from MY future, i dont want you guys telling me the things i do before i do them because you talked to future me!
GG: but knowing a few things about your future doesnt really matter, NOT that i am going to tell you any of it, so dont ask
GG: siiign, what are you even talking about?
GG: aw
GG: well...
GG: youll find him
GG: i know, i made an exception
GG: but only one!
GG: kanaya thinks we should all talk about this
GG: she says youre important to consult on the matter, but the you from her time is too busy
GG: :x!!!!!
GG: she is opening a memo
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005875
?GG: yeah...
?GG: its ok though. as long as he is tailing me like a lost puppy, at least hes not killing anybody
?GG: i remember the episode!!!
?GG: but hes ok now
?GG: and im kind of starting to think that was just his way of saying hi
?GG: my dog used to fetch my bullets too!
?GG: i really think he believes he is my dog, on some level
?GG: dont worry, im keeping my eye on him
?GG: aaaaaa no no no, bad jack, bad!!!!!!
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005876
?GG: yeah...
?GG: the poor froggies :(
?GG: youre probably right, they really seem to drive him crazy
?GG: this is not the first time i have had to reprimand him
?GG: he was growling at echidna and i had to tell him he was being very bad
?GG: he destroyed some of her really nice statues too
?GG: keeping him in line really makes me miss bec, he was such a good dog
?GG: not to mention a best friend
?GG: jack is just...
?GG: exactly
?GG: huh?
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005877
?GG: but you are a programmer arent you? that is at least kind of like being a scientist, having some technical savvy...
?GG: we know! you are clearly very good at being all of those things
?GG: but now we need your help with frog science. can you help us?
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005878
?GG: shhhhhhhshhhshhshshsh.....
?GG: SHOOSH
?GG: no future talk!!! lets stay on topic
?GG: kanaya means she is a very pretty girl with pointy fangs who has a bright sunny complexion and wears fancy dresses
?GG: and...
?GG: she drinks blood >_>
?GG: hee hee
?GG: yup :)
?GG: karkat...
?GG: that information qualifies as..........
?GG: FUTURE STUFF!
?GG: no wait! just please listen a little longer?
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005879
?GG: not exactly...
?GG: she just helped me remember
?GG: something from my past
?GG: if i accepted her terms
?GG: yeah because you never told me yours!!!
?GG: hmm
?GG: yeah she made me promise to do something that sounds impossible too
?GG: except......
?GG: i actually agreed :o
?GG: i have no idea how im going to keep my side of the bargain, now that i think about it
?GG: oh right
?GG: where the last frog is!
?GG: or was...
?GG: the thing is
?GG: the frog we need is nowhere to be found in the medium
?GG: it was on earth!
?GG: but only very briefly
?GG: it was when i was young
?GG: before i woke up on prospit
?GG: i had begun sleep walking
?GG: both on the island and on the moon
?GG: and in my dream it was very bright
?GG: i saw something in the light
?GG: i couldnt tell what it was so i got closer
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005880
?GG: but before i got there i woke up
?GG: and found myself by the lagoon surrounding the ruins
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005881
?GG: i was about to walk home
?GG: when i saw something appear on a lily pad
?GG: it was a frog!
?GG: an amazing shiny frog, not like any other ive seen in the lagoon
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005882
?GG: it hopped over to me and i picked it up
?GG: but then, just like that...
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005883
?GG: it died
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005884
?GG: later my grandpa made a robot for me to help me with my sleep walking
?GG: it could do all the walking while i stayed safe in bed!
?GG: it could also record my dreams
?GG: i am sure he always knew my dreams were going to be special
?GG: i suspect he knew it before i was even born
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005885
?GG: hopefully!
?GG: no, it completely slipped my mind
?GG: well, like it was before
?GG: the choices she gives you seem to have to do with facing mortality
?GG: and making it clear if you choose one path over another it will lead to your death
?GG: and that your death may even be necessary to accomplish a goal
?GG: yeah
?GG: but
?GG: that is not really what made this hard
?GG: i mean
?GG: nobody wants to die of course
?GG: but at least...
?GG: that is a clear thing
?GG: you either do you you dont
?GG: you know?
?GG: it might be
?GG: she said
?GG: that if i accepted her help
?GG: that i would have to make a promise
?GG: that whenever we left this place
?GG: and wherever we end up going
?GG: she had to come
?GG: not just echidna but all the denizens
?GG: their palaces their consorts their lands...
?GG: everything
?GG: i have to bring them all with us
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006001
[GG]
GG: oh sorry!
GG: i was distracted
GG: no not by all the scratchy stuff in the sky
GG: theres something coming down...
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006002
GG: its hard to make out
GG: but
GG: i think
GG: it might be...
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006003
GG: shaving cream?
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006004
GG: its like
[GG]
GG: hey!
GG: ...
GG: karkat?
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006196
JADE: im not sure!
JADE: some sort of limbo dimension between the two walls i guess
JADE: like a realm with unusual spatial properties we have to cross through
JADE: yes!
JADE: we still totally exist john
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006197
JADE: about what?
JADE: yes
JADE: i didnt make it with witch powers though, i captchalogued it hours ago because karkat told me to...
JADE: then at the last minute i took it out and made it huge so we could escape through it
JADE: i did make it huge with witch powers!
JADE: they also make things small
JADE: yup
JADE: also
JADE: witch powers can teleport things, and fling things around through space at very high velocities
JADE: all sorts of stuff!
JADE: but to be honest, im not sure how much of that is attributable to inheriting becs abilities...
JADE: yes that was the basic idea
JADE: that would be jake
JADE: and yeah, i do believe we will meet him in this session
JADE: he said he had a bunch of friends who helped him make the bunny! im pretty excited to meet them all
JADE: actually, they both went, and in a manner of speaking, their mission was a success
JADE: nope!
JADE: they did not actually destroy the sun. trust me, i would know if it was gone. now that i know what i know, it was kind of silly of us to think it would ever be destroyed...
JADE: and as it happens, rose and dave are not dead either! i have received very reliable reports that they survived
JADE: it will all be more clear soon
JADE: ive learned a lot in my dreams lately
JADE: heh, probably more than i ever learned looking at the clouds on prospit!
JADE: when i was dead there for a few minutes, i had one last very informative nap
JADE: the bottom line is, rose and dave will rendezvous with the trolls near the green sun, and then they will all meet us in the new session
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006198
JADE: its through the other wall!
JADE: yes
JADE: no, not lawn ring!
JADE: thats a silly troll word
JADE: its the yellow yard
JADE: we have to cross it to break through the next wall
JADE: see that long yellow band down there, stretching between the two walls?
JADE: i think thats supposed to be the yard
JADE: hmmm
JADE: yeah i think youre right
JADE: kinda like the yellow brick road?
JADE: hehe
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006200
JADE: :|
JADE: i have no idea
JADE: extra dimensional shenanigan based phenomena perhaps?????
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006202
JADE: i dont know!
JADE: :?
JADE: yes me too
JADE: hmmmmmm
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006203
JADE: im just trying to estimate our arrival time
JADE: based on our current velocity, which is about as close to light speed as i can make it go
JADE: hmmmmmmmmmmm...
JADE: no
JADE: itll take quite a bit longer than that
JADE: i would say
JADE: if i keep our speed constant...
JADE: we should arrive in about three years
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006204
JADE: i know!
JADE: i cant!
JADE: not here, at least
JADE: the way i understand it is...
JADE: becs powers draw from the green sun
JADE: and the green sun presides over our universe
JADE: many universes actually! and the sessions that created them, as well as the sessions created within them
JADE: including the trolls universe and their session
JADE: think of it like a giant solar system, but instead of planets revolving around the sun, there are many universes
JADE: it is!
JADE: so, bec was able to teleport anywhere in the universe he wanted in an instant, much faster than light
JADE: jack was able to do this too, within our session, and then when i inherited those powers from jadesprite, so could i
JADE: but we could only teleport locally
JADE: which means, bec could jump to anywhere in our universe, but not to another universe, or into a session
JADE: and jack could jump to anywhere in our session, but not outside it
JADE: we cant even jump to the green sun itself, even though we sort of serve as a gateway to it, and all its energy
JADE: and once we leave the suns domain, our travel is limited by the speed of light, like everyone else!
JADE: for example, the furthest ring is not in the suns domain
JADE: it is more like the suns medium, allowing it to exist
JADE: so if i wanted to fly out of our session and travel to the green sun, i would have to make my way there through the furthest ring at the speed of light or less
JADE: and wherever we are now is not in the suns domain either
JADE: so the same rules apply
JADE: yes i think youre right
JADE: but to be fair, we were all the victims of a big prank!
JADE: some really creepy omniscient guy
JADE: it doesnt matter much, hes supposedly dead now
JADE: yes, but its not all as bad as it seems
JADE: theres a silver lining in all of this
JADE: like you said, a sun presiding over many universes has to be pretty cosmically important
JADE: who knows what terrible consequences there would be if it was destroyed
JADE: or maybe worse, if it never existed at all
JADE: which is what made rose and daves true mission an unintended success!
JADE: to deliver the bomb to the empty location the green sun was meant to exist for most of eternity
JADE: and then create the sun in the first place
JADE: that is what the tumor was for all along
JADE: like i said
JADE: we got played like a bunch of suckers!!!
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006236
JADE: i think he looks cool!!!!!
JADE: the cape is great, hes like a super hero now
JADE: yup
JADE: ...
JADE: :(
JADE: !!!
JADE: ...........
JADE: how did you know about that!
JADE: oh
JADE: that figures
JADE: umm
JADE: yeah
JADE: i dunno
JADE: do you want it to come true?
JADE: hmmmmmm.....
JADE: i think i miss them already
JADE: and weve only been here for a few minutes :(
JADE: well
JADE: you could ask them now if you want
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006237
JADE: yes
JADE: in fact
JADE: you can hop right through me and join them
JADE: then you can travel with them to the new session if you like
JADE: it probably would!
JADE: but i cant go with you
JADE: i can serve as a gateway
JADE: but i cant travel to the sun myself, remember?
JADE: but its ok, really!
JADE: if thats what you wanted to do, i wouldnt mind
JADE: but whatever you do, you have to decide quickly
JADE: they will be departing from the sun very soon
JADE: i wouldnt really be alone though
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006238
JADE: i have the population of five planets to keep me company!
JADE: awww :D
JADE: ok then
JADE: personally, i think this trip could be a lot of fun!
JADE: theres no pressure to do anything important or run around like lunatics anymore
JADE: we can just relax
JADE: woof!
JADE: whoops
JADE: there should be lots of good stuff on the planets
JADE: also i would bet this ship is stocked with plenty of military rations
JADE: oh yeah!!!
JADE: durrr, problem solved
JADE: yes
JADE: im pretty sure she knows a ton of things now
JADE: considering she is a fully realized seer of light
JADE: im sure that would be hilarious
JADE: but
JADE: if you go i dont think i can bring you back
JADE: i cant bring anyone or anything to here from there!
JADE: as far as i know...
JADE: if theres a way i havent figured it out yet
JADE: i am still kind of new to this omnipotence thing after all :\
JADE: i dont know!
JADE: im sure the rules exist for a good reason though
JADE: maybe to somewhat limit the power and reach of omnipotent beings?
JADE: if there are no limits at all, it could be especially dangerous in the wrong hands
JADE: like what happened with jack!
JADE: then i guess thats what we are!
JADE: semipotent demigods
JADE: woof woof woof!
JADE: dammit!!!!!!
JADE: i havent gotten the hang of the woofs yet :(
JADE: i think so
JADE: i do too!
JADE: D:
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006239
JADE: sure!
JADE: better hurry up and write it though
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006240
JADE: how about this one?
JADE: looks like its still in pretty good condition
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006241
JADE: john you have to hurry!
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006242
JADE: here, will this work?
JADE: whatever you write just make it quick!
JADE: and tell everyone i say hi!
JADE: ok, while you work on that, i think ill bring up some friends
JADE: you know, let some of our travel companions get acquainted with the ship!
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006243
JADE: shooooooooosh!!!!!
JADE: write now, catch up later!
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006244
JADE: nooooo come on guys theyre about to go just stuff it in the bucket and throw it at me already!!!
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006629
JADE: john i really think we are scraping the bottom of the barrel here
JADE: thats sort of my point!
JADE: where did you even get this?
JADE: :|
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006630
JADE: i dont really think this is my kind of game....
JADE: but i will play it with you today because it is technically your birthday <3
JADE: how many people did you get to play this??
JADE: why cant you cross the streams?
JADE: :p
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006631
JADE: im working on it!
JADE: there are so many options
JADE: what kind of ghostbuster should i make?
JADE: hmmmm
JADE: what do you have to do?
JADE: noooooooooo!
JADE: sure john
JADE: whatever you say
JADE: are you serious?
JADE: what about that fire pole there?
JADE: cant you go down the fire pole?
JADE: .........
JADE: yeah i think im done!!!
JADE: im pretty happy with him
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006632
JADE: no way!
JADE: hes adorable, what are you even talking about?
JADE: i dont want ghosts to be afraid of him
JADE: i want to make friends with some ghosts if at all possible
JADE: nope. im keeping him :p
JADE: shut up or ill give him a pink jumpsuit!
JADE: i think i will manage to survive the embarrassment in front of a bunch of salamanders and crocodiles
JADE: thank you
JADE: *snicker*
JADE: nothing
JADE: hehe
JADE: pffff!
JADE: its davesprite, hes playing too
JADE: we have strategies?
JADE: hahahahahahaha
JADE: did you know...
JADE: davesprite is a funny guy?
JADE: i just told him you said that
JADE: davesprite says to tell you "youre basically welcome for being born 14 years ago and 1 year ago you ungrateful douche"
JADE: um
JADE: because he is davesprite?
JADE: well yeah
JADE: but hes kinda different from dave
JADE: i know
JADE: but there are other differences...
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006633
JADE: its hard to explain
JADE: just some slight differences in personality i guess
JADE: yes...
JADE: so?
JADE: ok i will admit i cant really tell if his rapping style has changed
JADE: i dont know if the differences are because he is a sprite
JADE: or because he lived for a while in a different timeline...
JADE: i wasnt a sprite!
JADE: my dead dream self was a sprite
JADE: and then i kind of merged with her when i became a god tier
JADE: i guess?
JADE: its more like im still the me i always was, but inherited some of her memories
JADE: but they are pretty vague
JADE: i remember being dead for a long time
JADE: and making friends...
JADE: mostly trolls
JADE: none that we know of now
JADE: that i can remember at least
JADE: they feel like such distant memories, like they were barely real
JADE: yeah me too
JADE: maybe its something about this place were traveling through?
JADE: when was the last time you visited one in your sleep?
JADE: yeah
JADE: yup
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006634
JADE: nope :(
JADE: i dont think thats it
JADE: for one thing, considering where we are, i dont think theres such a thing as "the same time" for us
JADE: maybe...
JADE: but its probably more like the way it used to be with the clouds in skaia
JADE: they didnt always show you things, but when they did they were selective about what they would let you see
JADE: like they would make sure you saw whatever you needed to see to make sure things would go the right way
JADE: i always thought i knew so much, but in retrospect they gave me only a tiny glimpse of the big picture!
JADE: i guess!
JADE: it never felt that way when all i was doing was looking up at some clouds
JADE: i was happy to see whatever was there
JADE: but i guess its different in a situation like this
JADE: when you miss your friends, and you kind of wish the dream bubbles would play along
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006635
JADE: heheh, probably!
JADE: hmmm
JADE: well look at it this way
JADE: by the end of our trip, will YOU be better friends with a bunch of salamanders than you are with rose and dave?
JADE: that is true
JADE: umm
JADE: what do you mean the way things are going?
JADE: what!
JADE: what has he been telling you??
JADE: well...
JADE: i guess i dont know whats going on with that
JADE: i really dont!!!
JADE: um
JADE: what
JADE: do you think he would think about that?
JADE: the other dave
JADE: i mean
JADE: hypothetically
JADE: im only wondering because you brought it up!!!!!!
JADE: then what do you think?
JADE: maybe
JADE: well
JADE: what about you john?
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006636
JADE: remember how you told me how karkat kept sort of trying to set you up with rose?
JADE: you told me this on more than one occasion if i recall!
JADE: well, i have kind of wondered to myself if you kept bringing that up because on some level you wanted that to be true...
JADE: not at all! that is perfectly fine
JADE: aww
JADE: heheheheh
JADE: what?
JADE: *snicker*
JADE: i guess you have a point
JADE: mm hm
JADE: yikes
JADE: .....
JADE: that was just my hunch
JADE: i sincerely doubt it
JADE: at least
JADE: i hope not ._.
JADE: that is so outrageous
JADE: after you!
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006637
JADE: grrr...
JADE: grrrrrrrrrrr
JADE: i cant help it!
JADE: grrrr...
JADE: dammit!
JADE: im really not mad at him, i swear!
JADE: WOOF!!!
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006638
JADE: WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF!
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=007184
JADE: hm?
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=007186
JADE: what?
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=007188
JADE: whaaat
JADE: but you love this movie!
JADE: but you were making such a big deal about finally getting me to watch it with you on your birthday!
JADE: you were going on and on about how i wouldnt be disappointed... but now youre saying you dont like it?
JADE: really?
JADE: i was actually kind of enjoying it!
JADE: its very silly
JADE: i really dont think its the kind of movie youre supposed to take all that seriously john
JADE: i dunno....
JADE: but people can change their minds about things
JADE: i think youre allowed to change your mind about a silly movie
JADE: i used to LOVE the squiddles show when i was really young
JADE: but as i got older i started to realize it wasnt as great as i thought it was
JADE: i was just too young to see how it was actually a flagrant vehicle for selling merchandise
JADE: and if you believed the conspiracy theorists it might have even been pushing some other dark hidden agendas.....
JADE: so i stopped liking the show itself as much but that didnt change the fact that i had a lot of fond memories about it
JADE: i still loved all the cute characters and could enjoy it on a nostalgic level
JADE: what is even the problem with it?
JADE: ive just been watching this and thinking, yup, i can see why john was so obsessed with this movie...
JADE: its funny!
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=007189
JADE: but he was trying to sound like a hardened criminal to win the trust of john malkovich!
JADE: what!!
JADE: you spent your whole life worshiping this dumb movie and now youre calling ME naive????
JADE: oh god
JADE: vexing and hypnotic??
JADE: its a movie full of explosions about a guy with a mullet
JADE: what is with you lately? you seem to be in such a crappy mood these days
JADE: oh bluh bluh
JADE: can we just finish the rest of the movie?
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=007190
JADE: look you made us miss a whole bunch of stuff!
JADE: hang on im going to rewind it...
JADE: whos dave chappelle?
JADE: no!!!
JADE: dont touch the remote
JADE: YES :p
JADE: john you are kind of sounding like a crazy person here
JADE: what???
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=007191
JADE: oh...
JADE: heh
JADE: yeah
JADE: why do you always call him dave sprite?
JADE: no, i mean why do you always say it like that? with the space between words?
JADE: its not dave sprite, its just davesprite
JADE: yeah.... john
JADE: i dont think davesprite is coming tonight
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=007192
JADE: no...
JADE: it has nothing to do with jaspers
JADE: he uh...
JADE: kind of broke up with me
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=007193
JADE: a couple days ago
JADE: john its ok you dont have t...
JADE: we were?
JADE: your rock??
JADE: what are you talking about?
JADE: we were not an institution!
JADE: you are just saying meaningless things now
JADE: um...
JADE: its complicated
JADE: basically hes just going through a lot of stuff right now
JADE: do uh...
JADE: you have a girlfriend?
JADE: i dont think hes a douche, hes just...
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=007194
JADE: i dont think being a bird ever bothered him
JADE: like i said... its all more complicated than that
JADE: me too
JADE: why?
JADE: i dont know
JADE: what do you mean
JADE: uh
JADE: so
JADE: SO WHAT IF HE HAS A GHOST BUTT!!!!!
JADE: WHATEVER YOURE JUST SAYING, JUST STOP SAYING IT!
JADE: and whatever youre trying to gesture with your hands there, stop doing that too!
JADE: nope!!! totally not talking about this
JADE: put your hands down john
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=007195
JADE: thats not down, thats up!
JADE: oh well, at least youre not making those unsettling gestures...
JADE: john...
JADE: what are you doing?
JADE: i hope youre not entertaining some awkward train of thought about, uh...
JADE: what is with you??
JADE: today is your birthday, youre supposed to be having fun!
JADE: but youve been so testy, as if youre committed to not having a good time
JADE: yeah, i can see how you might find it a little slow here
JADE: i dunno, i havent minded much... maybe its different for me though because i used to live all alone?
JADE: but i dont mind doing that any time!!!
JADE: john... if you told me this earlier i would have...
JADE: were already going as fast as i can make us go
JADE: about the speed of light!
JADE: no! nothing can go faster than light john
JADE: unless you teleport of course
JADE: i already explained this! i cant do that here, its not within the domain of the green sun which gives me those powers!
JADE: no thats just a regular law of physics!!! jeez
JADE: ok first of all, thats not even close to the speed of light
JADE: light travels at a hundred and eighty six thousand miles per second no matter what frame of reference youre in... even this one!
JADE: second of all special relativity and comparing laws of physics between different frames of reference, those are tricky issues to talk about!
JADE: but id be more than happy to talk about them if youd like. actually i would enjoy that because i never really get to talk about science wi...
JADE: yes as a matter of fact it is!
JADE: you take that back!!!!!
JADE: john.....
JADE: what is that?
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=007196
JADE: under your hood...
JADE: looks like a piece of paper stuck to your back?
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=007199
JADE: what?
JADE: what is it??
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=007200
JADE: where are you going?
JADE: what! john, no...
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=007201
JADE: ok yes, that practical joke is in poor taste, but you should try to calm down and...
JADE: um
JADE: which one?
JADE: sigh
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=007202
JADE: :|
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=007204
JADE: john...
JADE: theres no one there
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=007205
JADE: what pastures
JADE: what
JADE: wasnt i supposed to be the mule?
JADE: i dont think i understand your analogy
JADE: ....
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=007206
JADE: john i think youre officially throwing a tantrum here
JADE: ...
JADE: john?
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=007207
JADE: john...
