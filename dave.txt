TG: i was worried your priorities might have been out of whack but no i was dead wrong
TG: how is he
TG: i should probably text him soon
TG: see whats up
TG: because
TG: i love him
TG: so this place youre at now

TG: its like fucking christmas up in my bladder here
TG: and where do i find my toilet
TG: oh look here it is

TG: also dont put anything weird in the seizure kernel
TG: im going to go find somewhere to pee
TG: dont watch me ok
TG: like i know you dream about me enough already
TG: lets keep some shit left to the imagination ok
TG: the last thing i need is for your weird brain webcam to be snapping shots of my dong
TG: your grandpa was a sick fuck why would he build a voyeurbot for a little girl
TG: fuck
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=003344
TG: what
TG: what is it
TG: what bird
TG: i wouldnt know anything about that
TG: that could be anyones sword
TG: what does it look like
TG: is it a cheap piece of shit
TG: cause i only bother with high quality blades
TG: forged by stoic asian masters
TG: hells of rude kinds of expensive
TG: wait
TG: what do you mean
TG: dammit hold on a minute
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=003347
TG: wow awesome
TG: so now i guess instead having of a wise or helpful spirit guide sprite thing
TG: im stuck with this brainless feathery asshole
TG: we need to wake you up
TG: youre not very logical like this
TG: kind of dumb really
TG: yeah but come on you sleep like 20 hours a day
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=003348
TG: where are you sitting
TG: are you on your bed
TG: what side
TG: ok heres what i want you to do
TG: just humor me
TG: raise your left hand
TG: now
TG: just kind of swat the air to your left
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=003405
TG: oh man
TG: awesome
TG: its awesome where you put that
TG: i was worried we were on the verge of getting some shit done
TG: well where are they
TG: you say there will be stairs
TG: and yet
TG: i see no stairs
TG: sorry
TG: am i supposed to break that thing
TG: or hatch it
TG: or what
TG: also what happened to all my shit
TG: the stuff scattered all over the roof
TG: did you put it somewhere
TG: i mean not that i care
TG: it was a lot of mostly useless garbage
TG: i was going to use it to fight my bro with
TG: but i guess i forgot in the heat of battle
TG: also he was too fast
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=003407
TG: ok so
TG: the egg is now in a nest made of shitty swords and soft puppet ass
TG: please advise
TG: do you think thatll take more than four hours
TG: its hot as the sizzle side of the steak
TG: maybe i should try to get it back
TG: and put it in the microwave
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=003410
TG: you mean the jumper block thing
TG: wait what
TG: the thing costs 1000 for me
TG: what
TG: man i only got 200 to splash around with in roses rainbow world
TG: what the hell
TG: hang on ill ask
TG: she says 20
TG: yeah
TG: so i guess you can buy everything now
TG: ok now i know youre making this shit up
TG: well all i got here is the designix which i cant deploy cause i dont have any purples
TG: and the expensive as hell jumper thing and the cheap shunts which i assume do dick all without the jumpers to put em on
TG: oh also this cd which is 100 but i didnt drop cause it seemed like a stiff allocation of resources for now
TG: so with each new connection in our player chain i guess new weird deployables are introduced
TG: hey look we're learning stuff
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=003411
TG: what should i do with these beta copies
TG: i dont really need them anymore
TG: wow that was a weird answer
TG: but ok
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=003463
TG: ok
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=003464
TG: so i guess this is just a built in designix
TG: which is sort of cool i guess
TG: since i wont have to go downstairs and bang the hallway door into the thing and squeeze through every time i want to punch a card
TG: because of course you couldnt have just put it next to the alchemiter in the first place
TG: but then i have to go downstairs anyway to make totems and get cruxite and stuff
TG: so really who cares
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=003488
TG: im building up your house
TG: by the way why do you live in this weird compound
TG: do you host east european industrial raves
TG: nevermind the point is
TG: im out of grist
TG: so if youre done whipping that ogre like a rented mule
TG: maybe you could convert it into a grist windfall
TG: i dont know beach the thing first i guess
TG: unless you were planning on sailing that ogre down the mississippi with a runaway slave
TG: what do you mean
TG: you kill it
TG: release a shitload of grist
TG: maybe take one of your needles and puncture the base of its skull
TG: does it even have a skull
TG: or a brain stem
TG: can you find out
TG: what
TG: but you just rigged the thing with an oedipal harness and rode its torso like a log flume ride down a magical rainbow
TG: this is bullshit its an unfeeling monster who gives a fuck
TG: wow fuck ok
TG: you can either kill it for the loot or wait a couple hours for gristtorrent to steal more of johns
TG: but then again ill be pretty busy in a couple hours so make up your mind
TG: no but hes still got a ton so screw him
TG: yeah me too
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=003489
[TG]
TG: who
TG: oh yeah sure
TG: i command her alright i am like the pimpmaster hustledaddy of all snippy bookshrews
TG: wrong what do you want
TG: what the hell
TG: you have no idea dude she is so in my grill
TG: like a stray hotdog that rolled down there
TG: and now its too much trouble to fish out with the tongs
TG: so you just watch it like crack and turn black
TG: man wait
TG: whats this about
TG: you have a thing for her dont you
TG: dont deny it bro its obvious
TG: hahahaha so terrible
TG: what a transparent dodge
TG: all hiding behind your alien shit
TG: just admit it
TG: you want me to help you win her over
TG: ok well its easy
TG: for everything she says take her to mean just the opposite
TG: see not everybody always means literally what they say the way john and jade always do
TG: oh my flipping christ
TG: ok if you want rose to dig you you got to leave that crap in the shitty scifi novels where it belongs
TG: oh ok
TG: that was pretty good
TG: maybe even too deadpan but its a start keep at it
TG: hahaha yes youre on a roll
TG: oh
TG: alright look
TG: if you want to keep her attention you got to pull out all the stops
TG: reverse psychology mind games all sorts of machiavellian bullshit
TG: i mean unless youre really smooth and inherently likeable like me which youre not
TG: thats kind of the obtuse alien way of getting it but yeah
TG: be like
TG: an antagonism ninja
TG: like her
TG: i dont know you sort of remind me of her anyway so maybe thats a good thing
TG: it could be a horrible thing though
TG: yeah i guess i am
TG: i guess im saying be a less shitty troll
TG: good luck bro
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=003495
[TG]
TG: dont care
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=003537
[TG]
TG: ok im in
TG: the medium
TG: what do you mean already shit took 4 goddamn hours
TG: i dont want to talk about it
TG: imagine the worst day of my life
TG: just stood up and clinked a glass like it was about to give a speech
TG: then took a shit in my dinner and passed out with its pants down
TG: yeah
TG: stfu
TG: what are you doing
TG: ok
TG: i need some advice
TG: my kernelsprite which was this brainless feathery asshole with a sword in it
TG: turned into this bigger like ghostly feathery asshole
TG: with a sword in it
TG: it seems to want me to prototype it again
TG: not sure what to do
TG: shes asleep for some reason
TG: yeah i saw her there
TG: all tuckered out
TG: like she got smacked in the face with a pillow case full of the snooze wizards beard dander
TG: cause obviously its fuckin prime time for swiping some shuteye about now
TG: like a few hours into her magic stupid quest
TG: anyway what do you think
TG: ok fine but
TG: it seems to be suggesting something here
TG: and
TG: i guess im kinda weirded out by its suggestion
TG: ok well it definitely sounds like youre fucking something up over there
TG: but alright later
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=003542
DAVE: shut up
DAVE: no
DAVE: just
DAVE: god damn it
DAVE: please
DAVE: just once
DAVE: shut the hell up
DAVE: shut up
DAVE: shut
DAVE: the
DAVE: fuck
DAVE: up
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=003543
[TG]
TG: thats it i cant take it anymore
TG: it was such a huge mistake prototyping seppucrow with this useless mindnumbing jackass
TG: im going back
TG: what do you mean already shit took 4 goddamn months
TG: or something
TG: i dont know im kind of losing track of how long its been with all this time hopping
TG: what else is there to know
TG: we lost
TG: cant finish the game with a dead heir and witch
TG: yeah well she had a big fucking meteor bearing down on her and we never heard from her again
TG: or the trolls for that matter
TG: after they tricked john into skipping way ahead and getting his ass handed to him by the denizen
TG: i guess once they managed to sabotage us they were done with us
TG: and since john died he couldnt get jade in on time so whether shes alive or not shes as good as dead from our perspective 
TG: only thing left to do is change all that
TG: theres not much to remember
TG: i go back and tell john not to be an idiot and get trolled like such a gullible stooge
TG: i dont know what he was thinking
TG: even we couldnt kill one of those things yet
TG: with our higher levels and all our sick gear
TG: nah itll be fine dont worry
TG: i dont know
TG: i mean your whole timeline will
TG: maybe
TG: the thing with time travel is
TG: you cant overthink it
TG: just roll with it and see what happens
TG: and above all try not to do anything retarded
TG: try going to sleep
TG: our dream selves kind of operate outside the normal time continuum i think
TG: so if part of you from this timelines going to persist thats probably the way to make it happen
TG: and hey you might even be able to help your past dream self wake up sooner without all that fuss you went through
TG: the true purpose is to make a sprite that doesnt make me want to flog myself raw with my own brain stem
TG: anything else is gravy
TG: yeah thatd be cool i guess
TG: im gonna go now
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=003546
[TG]
TG: ok im in
TG: the medium
TG: what do you mean already shit took 4 goddamn hours
TG: i dont want to talk about it
TG: imagine the worst day of my life
TG: just stood up and clinked a glass like it was about to give a speech
TG: then took a shit in my dinner and passed out with its pants down
TG: yeah
TG: stfu
TG: what are you doing
TG: ok
TG: i need some advice

TG: wearing a rad suit
TG: he says dont go
TG: or youre gonna die
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=003549
TG: he says i dunno gullible enough to trust a leetspeaking troll who wants you dead and strap on a rocket pack cause she said to
TG: ok that was probably the dumbest thing you ever said just now
TG: do you hear what youre saying oh my god
TG: this guy is me if i get him to talk to you youre just talking to me again jesus it proves nothing
[TG]
TG: john stop being a tool and unbuckle yourself from that piece of shit
TG: if our friendship means anything youll listen to me and past dave
TG: this is future dave by the way
TG: yeah exactly why would i bother
TG: this sort of cornball horseshit is your cup of tea not mine
TG: dont make me track you down through time and stop you in person
TG: oh god did you just blast off
TG: ok well just dont ok
TG: im turning this timeline over to past dave
TG: and helping you all stay alive and do this thing the right way this time
TG: just stay on the goddamn ground for fucks sake
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=003551
DAVE: hey
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=003558
DAVE: who were you talking to
DAVE: ok cool
DAVE: so now that youre a sprite
DAVE: do you know everything about the game
DAVE: alright
DAVE: here goes
DAVE: why are we so fucking awesome
DAVE: yeah
DAVE: so is everything cool with this john business
DAVE: is he gonna be ok
DAVE: ok
DAVE: like what
DAVE: i was in the middle of the nancho party arc
DAVE: yeah that was sorta the plan
DAVE: making a ten part story about nachos was always a bullshit idea
DAVE: yeah sure
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=003562
so hey


since its your bday i had to get you back for the sick memorabilia you got me so i got you this godawful thing and now i just know youre standing there flipping your shit over it so youre welcome. 


its the actual gross bunny in the movie so that means nick cage actually grubbed it up with his clownish no talent fingers. i would suggest you put it somewhere and display it ironically but i know youre dead serious about this ridiculous shit so youll probably sleep with the damn thing and nibble its ear and stuff.


but the weird thing is thats whats cool about you. youre this naive guy like pinocchio tumbled ass backwards off the turnip truck and started liking ghostbusters. then the fairy godmother kissed your nose or some shit and you turned out to be not made of wood and also pretty cool to talk to. one day your gooberish ways are gonna land you in a jam and i know im going to have to get you off the hook but its cool i got your back bro.


then we'll meet and hug bump and get each others filthy wife beaters that much filthier so yeah


peace dawg

http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=003593

TG: but i think we can both agree that youve got to rummage through as much of her shit as possible before she wakes up
TG: dude no come on
TG: shes out like a light anyway
TG: it was some like weird future thing that happened that made her sleep
TG: yeah
TG: shit doesnt get more clear than that
TG: fine dont
TG: but here just do this one thing
TG: see those two notebooks on the floor behind you
TG: you dont have to read them im not telling you to
TG: what kind of prying tool do you take me for
TG: just pick them up
TG: you know like tidy up a bit since you made a royal fucking dump of her room just now
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=003594
TG: now i need you to do something else
TG: this is important
TG: like for important game reasons and stuff
TG: take the card the books are on
TG: flip it over
TG: so you can see the code
TG: dude you dont have to tell me the code
TG: just flip it over and let me know if theres a code there thats all
TG: alright cool
TG: you can ditch the books now if you want
TG: maybe put them back on the floor
TG: so rose doesnt think you were snooping
TG: seriously youve got some grubby fingers bro why dont you mind your own business there
TG: what is even with you
TG: isnt that your birthday package there
TG: maybe you should look at it
TG: i dont think it counts as snooping since its technically yours
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=003757
TG: whoa why are you burning your wizard fanfiction
TG: oh ok
TG: then why are you burning that
TG: is that some dumb wizard thing you just made up
TG: or something to do with tentacle monsters
TG: i cant keep track of what you like anymore
TG: john told me
TG: he was all snoopin around your room while you were asleep and i was like no man dont
TG: so not cool
TG: then he was like haha dude check it out this book is full of wizard slash
TG: and i was like i dont even want to know this is such a crazy violation of privacy
TG: do you want me to chew him out about it i will because that was so outrageous i dont know where he got off being like that
TG: i thought you hated wizards
TG: whats the deal with that
TG: oh man thats so messed up
TG: that you think that
TG: she probably digs wizards for real just like you and youre blowing shit out of proportion like pretty much always
TG: you and she could probably have been chatting up how awesome wizards were this whole time but no
TG: youre probably burning your nutjob meow book to spite her too arent you
TG: oh yeah
TG: i thought that was a joke
TG: when did they say that
TG: you mean when we were dancing and stuff in our dreams
TG: ive never seen or heard these things in my dreams
TG: uh yeah
TG: no what a ridiculous question
TG: ....
TG: ........
TG: ..........................
TG: dunno
TG: anyway yeah i guess ill do that
TG: get some sky monsters to boss me around sounds cool
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=003758
TG: are you talking to future me
TG: ok im out of the loop again
TG: between you taking orders from dream beasts and bird wing me with like
TG: future secrets
TG: im doing some sort of spectacular fucking jackknife off the loop and getting a wink and a nod from barack obana
TG: im coming upstairs
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=003761
DAVE: so it was pretty funny how i made a copy of roses evil book right before she burned it and now she doesnt know about it
DAVE: the best thing about how i did that is how it in no way will ever come back to bite us in the ass ever
DAVE: so safe
DAVE: safer than some flintstone vitamins in a bottle
DAVE: keep twisting junior all you get is clicks
DAVE: yeah
DAVE: anyway guess ill go back down and burn that book
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=003835
TG: what
TG: fuck off
TG: youre the annoying blind one arent you
TG: dave told me about you
TG: man im telling you burns like that are unreal
TG: where do you even get a burn thats that sick
TG: no you messed that up
TG: uh
TG: did you try to draw shades on his face and miss
TG: whats even the point hes already wearing shades
TG: this is moronic
TG: i dont know what it smells like or tastes like
TG: but i sure as hell know what it looks like
TG: like a fuckin symphony on my retinas
TG: shit is beautiful like a little vermilion picnic on my hands
TG: every day i open my eyes i find poetry in even the simplest things
TG: just one of those little joys in life you take for granted you know
TG: this miraculous gift of vision
TG: i could give myself a hernia trying to be as big a douche as that guy
TG: i could try but it would wind up like a motorcycle stunt gone horribly wrong
TG: my broken body would flop and tumble around like a rag doll
TG: and yet as much as that guys the tooliest dude i could ever hope to meet he and i would still get along famously
TG: cause we can both see
TG: just him and me
TG: havin a see party
TG: like a couple of eagle eyed bros peepin shit up into the wee hours
TG: i guess but youll have to be careful not to stumble around bumping into all the gorgeous masterpieces hanging around everywhere
TG: god so beautiful to look at with my perfect eyesight
TG: yeah thats fine
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=003839
TG: oh hell
TG: that

TG: davesprite doesnt know
TG: you can see everything that goes on right

TG: how does that even work
TG: how do you use a computer and know whats going on it doesnt make sense
TG: my face doesnt make sense
TG: hahaha
TG: ew
TG: oh ok
TG: so the dumbest and most far fetched explanation imaginable ok got it
TG: man dont remind me about that
TG: so embarrassing
TG: ok cool
TG: whos upset
TG: bout time the dude gave me a little space
TG: i guess
TG: alright so whats next
TG: why would i be scared
TG: we have cotton candy dumpass
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004637
[TG]

TG: man who cares
TG: i mean thats great and all
TG: but i talked to you plenty more times since that from where im standing
TG: ive got to make this quick
TG: fuck no fuck that trollian horseshit
TG: its just regular old time travel
TG: im from the future
TG: no
TG: just regular ordinary dave from the fucking future nothing special dude come on
TG: yeah ok it is awesome but im in a hurry
TG: i need to borrow some boondollars off you
TG: no they do do something
TG: what do you think they buy shit its fucking money
TG: i cant answer all these questions dude youll find out anyway its not like youll even really need your money
TG: you you might as well give it to me
TG: all of it
TG: man you just said you thought it was useless why do you care
TG: ill pay you back
TG: in the future
TG: if theres one thing im not short on its the fuckin future
TG: yeah we do
TG: but chronologically ive been around for at least triple that
TG: no shit your deal is wind not time
TG: youre on easy street what is there even to think about with wind
TG: like what angle to blow it at to fly a damn kite or how gentle its gotta be to make a picnic go swimmingly
TG: its kiddie bullshit time is serious fucking business
TG: leave it to the pros ok
TG: yeah it can work that way
TG: or not
TG: ive been very careful
TG: this whole operation is strung together with stable time loops
TG: no timeline offshoots cause thats when daves start dying and that isnt no good for nobody
TG: yeah
TG: there are a bunch of daves running around the timeline
TG: but they are all me
TG: i mean they will all become me and ill become them one way or another
TG: thats how stable time loops work shit takes a lot of planning and precise choreography
TG: ive got some help though
TG: yeah
TG: man dont even get me started with that
TG: the 24 hour span of the reckoning is like some kind of critical spike in us dealing with troll bullshit
TG: i guess its just when the most shit is going down so they figure thats the best time to mess with us
TG: i dont know man they seem to flock to me
TG: ive been laying waste to chumps nonstop
TG: its like they heard somebody over here was handing out asses and theyve known nothing but years of bitter ass famine
TG: oh you know
TG: noirs outta control
TG: rose is crazy jades crazier and youre
TG: well youre you
TG: and together were up to our bulges and miscellaneous bullshit alien physiology in hot sloppy shenanigans while hatching plans under our feathery asses like a bunch of cage free farm fresh motherfuckers
TG: but im not about to get into specifics cause this is complicated enough as it is
TG: and if i started ranting too much about the future id start sounding like one of these smug alternian shitheads and im not about to drop that retarded science on my good bro
TG: so im staying on track here
TG: speaking of which
TG: give me your money
TG: oh christ
TG: only one
TG: well fuck nevermind then
TG: i thought youd have more by now but thats goddamn peanuts
TG: i mean
TG: ill take it anyway but damn
TG: im working the system here
TG: using time loops to manipulate the incipispheres financial sector
TG: making a goddamn killing in the lohacse
TG: lohac stock exchange
TG: my planet
TG: land of heat and clockwork dude come on
TG: you know like gears and lava and shit
TG: wrong it kicks ass
TG: egbert stfu and give me your goddamn boonbuck j3gus fuck

TG: deploy the intellibeam laserstation
TG: no it costs practically nothing
TG: check out how much ive got
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004926
TG: its mostly pretty stupid and useless
TG: but itll come in handy here
TG: it reads captcha codes
TG: yeah
TG: some are too garbled and complicated
TG: the human eye cant decipher them
TG: needs sophisticated scanning technology
TG: and artificial intelligence to figure it out
TG: yeah well
TG: thats why this is so dumb
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004927
TG: i guess some captchas are so incomprehensible cause the game thinks it would be too cheap to let you duplicate them
TG: like an anti piracy measure
TG: so the solution to the anti piracy measure is to override the anti spam measure
TG: well yeah thats what captchas are for
TG: and theyre on the back of cards for a really good reason
TG: cause god knows the last thing youd want was some web bot being able to figure out the code for like
TG: a potted plant
TG: that would be fucking mayhem
TG: but in order to effectively cheat here weve got to open pandoras spam box
TG: and release the laserstation into the world with its leering intellibeam
TG: now no captcha is safe youll have bots signing up for email accounts and duplicating potted plants and shit
TG: basically robots are in control now
TG: which is good news and bad news
TG: the bad news is theyre all pornbots and theyve got LOADS of provocative material theyre just dying to share with us
TG: thats also the good news
TG: whats it look like
TG: im duplicating my server disc
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004928
TG: nah i told you were not bothering john
TG: hes got shit to do
TG: ill just install it
TG: dont see why not
TG: we have to get creative here
TG: this games already so far off the rails what else is there to do but improvise
TG: well he was
TG: he got you in didnt he
TG: but now hes not
TG: been a change of plans
TG: time to roll with it
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004929
TG: yeah more or less
TG: i never really studied how it went down all that closely
TG: i just figured when the time came to sort it out the right thing to do would be obvious
TG: like it is now
TG: managing the loops is a balance of careful planning and just rolling with your in the moment decisions
TG: and trusting they were the ones you were always supposed to make
TG: by now im pretty used to having my intuition woven into the fabric of the alpha timeline
TG: yeah i know
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004930
TG: thisll be the disc i use for your connection
TG: while the original will stay bound to roses connection
TG: well technically
TG: i will be your server
TG: and past me will stay as roses server
TG: which is to say present me will
TG: the one in the black suit
TG: he can keep managing her for a while
TG: until she sorta checks out soon and becomes totally useless
TG: then he can start hopping around time like i did
TG: make a ton of money and stuff
TG: eventually become me
TG: and become your server player
TG: yeah see its not hard to get the hang of
TG: in the meantime ill kind of loiter around this timeframe to help you out for a while
TG: dont worry about it just some more future stuff
TG: now i need you to go downstairs
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004931
TG: im just going to cut right to the chase and upgrade your alchemiter so you can avoid a lot of bullshit
TG: ill give you some codes and you can punch cards and slip em into jumper blocks
TG: which are really the exact same codes you first gave me when we upgraded my alchemiter
TG: which seems like a hella long time ago
TG: yeah but it kind of literally is for me
TG: few days i guess
TG: whatever
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004936
[TG]
TG: nak nak nak
TG: THE GLASSES ARE TALKING AGAIN
TG: naknaknaknaknaknaknaknaknaknaknaknaknaknak
TG: :V
TG: :(
TG: hey
TG: what just happened
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004937
TG: oh yeah
TG: so shes here then
TG: is she ok what was going on there
TG: i guess i should catch up with her
TG: i am
TG: oh ok time travels involved
TG: thats all you needed to say everythings cool and under control then
TG: weird
TG: and kind of boring
TG: i was in your dream room for a while spying on you
TG: being all creepy and dream duplicitous and shit
TG: whats with your book collection
TG: or
TG: dream book collection
TG: all your books are bizarre and terrible
TG: nah
TG: but yeah i understand defending your collection i guess if you were in my dream room and talking shit about my awesome dream portraits of dream stiller and dream snoop or whatever wed have to have a fucking talk
TG: oh
TG: yeah
TG: i did
TG: horrible things
TG: yeah
TG: it was like
TG: peering through the dark portal of an eldritch red lobster
TG: and scoping out its all you can eat seafood buffet
TG: and
TG: when i saw them
TG: their voices became clearer
TG: i couldnt really focus on anything specific
TG: but
TG: in totality
TG: im pretty sure it was
TG: like
TG: a plea for help
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004939
TG: no it was disturbing
TG: so i slapped my shades back on
TG: went and perved up some sleeping girls room to take my mind of it
TG: oh god why would i want that 
TG: im not about to get molested by calamari with fucking teeth
TG: use your powers and like
TG: stroke a mummys paw or some horseshit and open a dark channel
TG: tell them to keep their lecherous flagella to themselves
TG: whats that mean
TG: who cares if theyre getting killed
TG: theyre hideous and obnoxious
TG: oh ok cool
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004940
TG: oh shit youre kidding
TG: no really are you serious i didnt even notice
TG: fuck mind = blown
TG: ok
TG: what am i supposed to do
TG: like
TG: a treasure map
TG: why
TG: plot a course to what
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004941
TG: oh right the green sun ok
TG: wait sorry
TG: i mean the  my bad
TG: whats the deal with this thing
TG: i mean aside from giving jades dog his devil powers
TG: and by extension i guess jack
TG: yeah
TG: how big
TG: i need a sense of scale here
TG: is it like the size of our sun
TG: or bigger
TG: or is it only as big as like
TG: planet fucking jupiter
TG: ok thats pretty fucking big
TG: see how important that contextualization was now i know how fucking impressed i should be
TG: i mean hopy shit thats huge
TG: so ok i make a map to this thing
TG: with the help of a million rambunctious gross tentacle mutants
TG: and then i guess we go there for some reason
TG: why do we need a map
TG: cant they just
TG: tell us what direction its in
TG: point a spaceship that way
TG: blast off to adventure
TG: i can kind of get that time is messed up there
TG: with like loops and causality paradoxes and shit like that
TG: being the knight of time here
TG: not really sure why navigating the space would be a problem though
TG: space isnt my thing remember
TG: what is it like
TG: full of wormholes or something
TG: i thought you werent supposed to know shit about either
TG: seeing as youre the seer whatever that means
TG: fair enough
TG: so i take my map and fly to this thing
TG: ok you fly to it
TG: then what
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004942
TG: you mean with the quest youre sending him on
TG: is there anything you do thats not sending dudes on quests
TG: so hes got to get the cancer out of skaia right
TG: yeah
TG: so whats 
do
TG: i mean the tumor
TG: jesus can we stop with the fancy colored text bullshit
TG: well ok you can keep doing it then
TG: ok cool what is it
TG: ok i wont say anything
TG: just tell me
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004943
TG: what the hell is a bomb doing in there
TG: first time for everything i guess
TG: seriously whered you get all this info
TG: did you get it all from the gods
TG: are these just a bunch of orders youre following
TG: what
TG: what you mean a troll
TG: sounds like a really credible dude sign me up for trusting everything he says
TG: oh so he knows everything
TG: even if he is omniscient which he probably isnt what if hes just lying
TG: whys he want to die
TG: wait
TG: what
TG: ok i get it now
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004944
TG: whoa fuck
TG: a suicide mission are you serious
TG: no bullshit thats not happening
TG: hey look suddenly everything we just talked about was useless because its time to make a plan that doesnt fucking suck
TG: oh
TG: haha yeah thats fine i guess
TG: those fuckers are all kinds of mad expendable
TG: way to leave me hanging there
TG: for someone whos saying lets cool it on the drama the whole i wont be coming back thing is a pretty theatrical bombshell
TG: for future reference
TG: yeah i know
TG: so when do i do my thing
TG: make this map
TG: which i guess is just like
TG: a solid black piece of paper
TG: this is going to be fucking stupid isnt it
TG: alright
TG: so
TG: dog it as long as possible
TG: then travel back to about now and go to sleep
TG: what
TG: no
TG: oh yeah terezi
TG: no shes cool
TG: its blossoming into an interspecies partnership in incredibly shitty cartooning
TG: what do you mean get her to trick someone into putting me asleep again
TG: when did that happen
TG: who did that
TG: god
TG: fuckin trolls
TG: too many of them who can even keep track of this shit
TG: which ones yours
TG: is it the absurd juggalo one that would be hilarious
TG: yeah see what i mean
TG: oh ok
TG: well im suddenly not interested so go talk to your fairy god troll
TG: ill be over here paving the way for your elaborate dream suicide
TG: when i feel like getting around to it i mean
TG: later
[TG]
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004991
[TG]
TG: ok
TG: what do you mean what
TG: but
TG: you know if im going to or not
TG: its lame for you to pretend theres any element of suspense here
TG: why dont you just tell me
TG: look i dont mind making the decision if thats whats going on here
TG: like doing the free will thing
TG: yes how would it ever stop being a thing
TG: being a things not something it ever stopped doing
TG: i just want to know whats really going on here
TG: before i decide to start choppin off the heads of outrageously good looking snoozing dudes
TG: ok i know but
TG: something about this doesnt add up
TG: who is this guy
TG: i dont remember sleeping on this bed
TG: or reaching the god tier im pretty sure thats something id remember
TG: so is he from the future
TG: does this mean later im going to have to put this ugly goddamn suit back on
TG: which i thought we both agreed id retired from the wardrobe forever
TG: and then go back in time and sleep in this bed and get killed by me right now
TG: do i have the stable loop right
TG: then what
TG: why wouldnt i be concerned about that
TG: if we make mistakes then dead daves start piling up
TG: and dead daves are the enemy remember
TG: says the sword holding guy whos about to add one to the pile
TG: who
TG: ok got it
TG: i wonder if this can finally be the conversation that doesnt deteriorate into a lot of bitching and moaning about her
TG: so if im understanding this
TG: this guy isnt from the future who came back to finish a loop
TG: and hes not from the past because id remember doing this
TG: so this isnt part of our timeline choreography at all
TG: must be from an offshoot timeline
TG: which means hes doomed
TG: ok so how did this happen where did we fuck up
TG: what exactly did you do
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004992
TG: yeah i remember
TG: that seems like a long time ago already
TG: what was that like more than a day for me chronologically
TG: ok but you didnt actually give me a choice
TG: you just flipped a coin
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004993
oops red is how i talk, my bad
OH MY GOD...
D4V3 TH1S 1S SO D3C4D3NT
WHY D1DNT YOU 3V3R T3LL M3 HOW 4M4Z1NG 1T 1S TO TYP3 L1K3 TH1S
1 4LMOST C4NT H4NDL3 1T >:o
TG: ok stop that shit is probably like crack to you
TG: im not going to stand by and watch you fall prey to your own wild cherry apeshit apocalypse
TG: the arrangement being the coin flip thing
TG: thank god we did that otherwise wed be screwed
TG: i probably would have gone back in time and killed my own grandfather oh wait i never had one
TG: oh yeah
TG: twoface is a human batman villain whos half ugly and flips coins all the time to make evil decisions
TG: its ok flippin coins for reasons is still pretty badass i guess
TG: why dont you finish your story
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004994
TG: right exactly
TG: so like i said before i had no choice at all i picked some options and you flipped a coin
TG: not seein it
TG: i picked good heads to mean youd show me now
TG: bad heads to mean youd show me later
TG: you said it came up bad heads
TG: so i was like ok i can wait
TG: and i did for like a whole day
TG: and now here you are showing me
TG: did i miss something
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004995
TG: then
TG: this is kind of useless isnt it
TG: i thought you were bringing me back here to finish a stable time loop not murder a guy you punked whos gonna die regardless
TG: whats the fucking point of giving a doomed version of myself superpowers anyway
TG: its just the worst thing when you get morbid
TG: anyway maybe
TG: but i kind of doubt thats how it works i mean
TG: doomed means doomed doesnt it
TG: the loopholes are only temporary like look how davesprite turned out
TG: am i wrong in guessing that
TG: shouldnt you know better than me
TG: i dont know
TG: what does being a seer of mind actually mean
TG: oh ok its someone who asks a bunch of dumb riddles i figured it out already
TG: lets not get derailed here
TG: we were talking about a serious issue and im standing over my soon to be corpse while holding a fucking sword
TG: punishing
TG: i guess
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004996
TG: i dunno none of this is making for a very persuasive argument that i should kill doomed me
TG: see
TG: this shit youre doing now
TG: this is the morbid shit i was talking about
TG: its not anywhere near as endearing as you probably think
TG: even when you bracket smile after it
TG: like ok you said something fucked up but hey theres a cute face my heart just fucking melted
TG: ok yeah youre right i just got won back over totally
TG: i think
TG: this whole thing was a ruse
TG: and not even the funny kind that qualify as distactions
TG: i think you got my whole timeline there in front of you and you know damn well i have no intention of killing this guy ever
TG: and its just a big game you set up to watch me squirm over weird mortality issues while you giggle
TG: so
TG: i guess
TG: well played??????
TG: i dont know
TG: just one question
TG: and please just drop your fucking justice riddles and be honest
TG: do i ever make the god tier
TG: like the right way
TG: ok
TG: then cool i guess i can live without wearing a sweet windsock hoodie and making time tornadoes or whatever
TG: i was only bugging you about it cause you were being so vague
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004997
TG: alright then
TG: i guess thats enough of this horseshit time to move on right
TG: i dont even want to be around when he wakes up itll be weird and awkward
TG: no fuck no
TG: put your fucking death coin away jesus
TG: i am forbidding you from ever flipping that coin again when youre talking to me or even thinking about me
TG: what you didnt
TG: thats fucking idiotic
TG: you could smell a flea off a dogs balls
TG: this is bs
TG: so ok your coinflip of death was meaningless great to know
TG: is there anything else we need to do here
TG: i sent you the money i got all the fraymotifs tell me what is there thats left besides you jerking me around
TG: probably time we chill out for a while and i get back in sync with my teammates
TG: then i guess thats where ill go
TG: ok
TG: i mean
TG: im not even actually mad i just
TG: i dunno
TG: i still dont really get what you did
TG: was the trick really necessary
TG: it sounds like
TG: the splitoff was a result of both possible decisions i could have made
TG: and had fuckall to do with your coin or randomness or luck
TG: get what
TG: yeah
TG: and
TG: i obviously still dont know
TG: i dont know sounds like a riddle
TG: fuck it ill just say all of it
TG: i mean that is the answer right
TG: oh ok
TG: really well
TG: i know it biblically its an obscene nsfw spectacle
TG: means my skull is a bucket and my brains a plump fuckgrub
TG: oh do you
TG: is that what you were doing just now
TG: yeah no fuck
TG: man
TG: you are just
TG: some kind of knowitall arent you
TG: what else do you know
TG: like
TG: yeah because
TG: you didnt even look
TG: it was like
TG: schrodingers fucking coin
TG: and then
TG: it turned into schrodingers fucking dave
TG: yeah
TG: what
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005041
TG: yes perfect
TG: ok im going to torrent you another like negative billion artifact grists
TG: yeah
TG: now draw the conksuckiest boot you ever drew
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005042
TG: its the conksuckiest piece of fucking shit that ever still somehow qualified as a boot
TG: you just know imigrants were responsible
TG: yeah see what i mean
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005090
[TG]
TG: well that was apparently pointless
TG: now what
TG: hello
TG: terezi
TG: whats up
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005104
[TG]
TG: this is a dave out there whats up
TG: it wasnt a future dave he was from a while ago
TG: sorry you had to see that
TG: but dont worry it was just a doomed dave no big deal really
TG: i was swindled into splitting time paths along the way and that guy got the dead end of the stick
TG: ill be fine
TG: yes you are go ahead and be relieved
TG: nice
TG: yeah
TG: hes pretty much the guy in charge of random teleportation murders right now
TG: what
TG: my bro
TG: yeah jack killed him too
TG: not much to talk about
TG: this is some pretty serious existence threatening shit going down and some people are going to die i guess
TG: even crazy hard dudes like my bro slash weird covert biological ghost dad
TG: yeah roses too
TG: i thought john filled you in on the ectobiology stuff
TG: bottom line is were all related slimewise except you and me and him and rose pairways respectively
TG: makes the shipping chart pretty simple here hang on while i dig up that piece of shit karkat made
TG: where the fuck did that thing go
TG: fuck it never mind
TG: just imagine something ugly made by a jackass
TG: i guess
TG: meh it was a pretty bizarre relationship by any standard
TG: fightin off wave after wave of face pumicing puppet ass every day
TG: always being on guard for stealth attacks in the middle of the night while getting up to go to the fucking bathroom
TG: but i guess it all sorta amounted to some vague unspoken semblance of kinship
TG: if thats a thing
TG: like if honor among thieves is something then lets call it camaraderie among ironic rapping roof ninjas
TG: but thanks
TG: i thought about taking his sword
TG: when i was there
TG: but i couldnt
TG: couldnt really bring myself to try to pull it out it was too weird
TG: what
TG: you think
TG: well id like to
TG: but im still trapped in the chronologistics of this fuckin one man ballet
TG: there are loops outstanding and if i step out of line you get to see more bloody daves
TG: im getting pretty sick of it but i think itll be over soon
TG: then ill break out and ride linear the rest of the way i think
TG: once its time to put the end game in motion
TG: til then youre on your own for a while
TG: besides we cant beat him
TG: look what he did to bro and davesprite together
TG: im at the top of my echeladder with all the fraymotifs and i stand no chance
TG: johns even better than that even though he doesnt know it at the moment
TG: and he stands no chance either
TG: only thing we can do is hold out until the scratch
TG: guess i shouldnt really say
TG: since you sort of lead the way in making that plan
TG: yeah well
TG: suffice to say
TG: if we cant beat him
TG: all we can really do is exile him to a place where he cant teleport back
TG: which hopefully buys us some time
TG: to try to take out his power source in a crazy suicide mission
TG: kinda
TG: well
TG: youre about to do what youre about to do
TG: and im not going to tell you not to
TG: i wont do the bullshit troll thing and tell you what youre going to do and then just dare you not to
TG: while knowing damn well you will anyway
TG: so ill just say
TG: whats next is up to you
TG: and if later you want to talk about it
TG: im here

TG: oh sup

http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005384
TG: these arent my shades anymore
TG: john gave me these new ones for my bday
TG: i remember that
TG: and i wasnt wearing this shirt
TG: it was this one
TG: howd it get like that
TG: i cant
TG: wait
TG: i wasnt wearing this actually
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005385
TG: i was wearing this suit
TG: no wait
TG: it was a black one
TG: yeah
TG: and i was playing sburb
TG: thats right
TG: and then i went to sleep at some point
TG: which is why im asleep now
TG: but
TG: if im dreaming
TG: then why am i not awake as my dream self
TG: shit
TG: this wasnt the suit i was wearing
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005386
TG: it was this ugly fucking rag
TG: and i went to take a nap
TG: terezi said id reach god tier
TG: or i guess show me why i wouldnt
TG: did it work is this part of the process somehow
TG: so then
TG: its just a stupid pointless dream
TG: wait
TG: oh yeah
TG: i woke up
TG: and then
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005387
TG: welp
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005388
TG: so then
TG: im dead
TG: then this isnt a memory or a dream at all
TG: its the afterlife
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005389
TG: ok
TG: what is going on over here then
TG: is this some disturbing ghost hallucination should i start slapping myself or what
TG: i dont remember this
TG: fuck
TG: lucky bastard
TG: so then i guess terezi tricked me
TG: it would have been cool to know if picking one option would definitely kill me pointlessly so yeah
TG: but i guess i kept giving her shit about it and i knew she was kind of crazy and morbid anyways so whatever
TG: is
TG: bro dead there
TG: like in reality
TG: like thats a thing that really happened
TG: also
TG: is reality still a thing that means something can that be a question on the table too
TG: well
TG: dammit
TG: what did i do wrong
TG: aside from getting my ass killed in the most retarded way possible
TG: whats he doing
TG: alpha me
TG: i am him
TG: i dunno
TG: yeah
TG: sorta
TG: maybe
TG: ok
TG: am i talking to someone there
TG: who
TG: probably
TG: terezi i guess
TG: i dunno
TG: would she do that
TG: was i
TG: so
TG: im just one dead dave offered up to the time god
TG: what about the other dead daves
TG: uh
TG: i think
TG: im up to my neck in dave already
TG: just being one
TG: still doesnt seem right though
TG: why are you even here like why are you showing me this
TG: but like
TG: if im seeing this
TG: shouldnt i be able to do something about it
TG: or stop it from happening or
TG: i dont know like anything to keep helping my friends
TG: what do i do
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005390
TG: where are we now
TG: oh so this is the trollplanet
TG: pretty cool not really what i pictured
TG: i dont know its more subdued
TG: i pictured a lot more mayhem like
TG: a bunch of trolls flying around in little grub pods constantly screaming at each other through bullhorns shaped like buckets
TG: hahaha
TG: can we not go to those parts
TG: awesome
TG: so what am i supposed to do now that im dead
TG: what is like
TG: the primary activity here
TG: that ghosts get their shit worked up over
TG: like
TG: where are the fucking hauntoffs at is what im asking
TG: boring
TG: just kidding that sounds cool
TG: what else
TG: it isnt
TG: ha
TG: haha
TG: i bet you meant a laugh a whole lot less shitty than that
TG: yeah sure
TG: well
TG: how about later
TG: not that that doesnt sound cool but i kind of want to just go home
TG: and i guess chill for a while cause i guess it was all a bit much
TG: if thats ok and i guess also possible

TG: what do you mean what
TG: we just got done talking and agreed it would be awesome if you didnt bother me for a while
TG: you know like while i guess i grieved over this brutally murdered rad family member or something
TG: it was five seconds ago
TG: so youre officially going nonlinear with me then
TG: were just forfeiting all rhyme or reason to this unmitigated clusterfuck is that it
TG: whoops ok in the future ill try not to pitch any sort of dramatics while brooding over the cadavers of slaughtered loved ones
TG: no
TG: puppets arent cool theyre shitty small fake people who haunt your dreams and grin like permanent assholes
TG: i was making a joke about being all broken up about it
TG: a guy can be sad and make jokes at the same time
TG: exactly
TG: i said we agreed youd leave me alone to grieve
TG: didnt say whether i actually would or actually am
TG: i am grieving to the max like a widow on dead husband island
TG: behind these chill as fuck shades my face is having this crazy attack of the sads
TG: my rue is fucking bananas cant you tell
TG: the truth is a mystery
TG: tucked behind the pursed lips of a shitty riddler
TG: they will be loosened only when presented with the conundrous grandeur of rigid insoluble puzzlecock
TG: im sorry you are so flustered by the mere mention of glittering mythical cryptodick it honestly makes me think youre not ready for the truth
TG: its pretty simple
TG: im just thinkin about how im gonna take this sword
TG: filthiest thing you ever said
TG: forget it
TG: pulling swords out of things isnt how i roll
TG: im not john remember
TG: im not a hero
TG: my bro was
TG: john is
TG: im not
TG: no
TG: fine its a title we inherit as phlegm babies or whatever but what have i done to earn it
TG: pretty much nothing but horsing around through time and swindling retarded alligators out of their life savings
TG: if that swords coming out of his chest its coming out clean
TG: taking it vertically means drawing more blood
TG: but horizontally means a clean break
TG: check it
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005603
TG: no fuck that
TG: im a lie my ass right down here for a while looking slightly less cool than i make myself out to be ordinarily
TG: that is basically what i just did isnt it
TG: thats what im doing here im making a point of makin every little thing take place what was once mentioned in passing no matter how seemingly trivial or pointless
TG: thats how all the best adventures get strung together
TG: you havent heard me bleat like a goat for ironically humorous purposes yet have you
TG: that was something that was mentioned at some point by someone i forget when or why
TG: i bet you are on goddamn pins and needles waiting for that arent you
TG: no
TG: fuck that
TG: no
TG: fuck you
TG: go away
TG: what
TG: i dunno
TG: why are you even talking to me anyway
TG: aside from the fact that several hours from now you apparently forget i dont need consolation and oughta be left alone
TG: oh
TG: bitten
TG: what
TG: that sure sounds like a dumb way to say a thing
TG: almost egbertian in elegant stupidity
TG: the t in egbertian is soft like shhhhh
TG: why would i get mad at you
TG: ok
TG: but yeah i guess its about time you showed me whats up with my allegedly futile god tierification
TG: how long ago was it that you did your coin flip thing i dont even remember
TG: i was getting sure you were just bullshitting me and had no intention of ever mentioning it again
TG: for what
TG: before what happens
TG: you mean god tiering
TG: does something go wrong
TG: thats practically unthinkable
TG: but i mean ok we can talk about your troll problem but this is pretty important here
TG: the god tier thing and whether i can actually do it or not
TG: it might be kind of hard to tell on account of me chilling face down on the pavement and also because downplaying feelings is the chief rule of cool but im pretty pissed about this
TG: which is weird
TG: no its not weird to be mad its just weird it feels like im the only one who is
TG: and the only one even contemplating taking jack on
TG: even among your group of irate gnashing shitheads
TG: what
TG: well ok
TG: and that would be a bitchin line to switch the subject to start talkin about your complicated problems but i kinda wasnt done
TG: but ok i mean isnt that what heroes should be doing
TG: working to take down the bad guy without a whole lot of this fuckin grandiloquence and these huge sweeping plans that got nothin to do with fighting him
TG: like always biding our time and tiptoeing around the unbeatable god boss
TG: johns too nice to get mad
TG: rose spends all her time calculating
TG: too focused on machiavellian ploys of sabotage to try anything drastic
TG: jade is
TG: i dont even know
TG: probably more a liability if she got it in her head to take him down
TG: if anything id bet she just needs protection
TG: im just wondering
TG: when does someone actually step up
TG: jacks got shit to pay for
TG: yeah i guess
TG: i guess it has been on my mind
TG: maybe i am supposed to be a hero and rise to the occasion because there seems to be this little persistent voice in my head nagging me about it
TG: insisting someones gotta pay
TG: and its hard for me to disagree
TG: what things
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005604
TG: im pretty sure i dont even have an exile
TG: ive never heard any voices or anything
TG: anyway you dont need a voice in your head to tell you this shit is
TG: just like
TG: so completely illegal
TG: wait
TG: why did i just say that stupid thing i said
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005605
TG: no i mean
TG: ok that came out wrong
TG: what were we talking about again
TG: right
TG: someone has to make him pay
TG: cant let him just go unpunished
TG: if i can figure out how to reach the god tier maybe i can be the one to throw him into the slammer
TG: slammer means jail
TG: you call it the slammer when youre extra angry at crimes
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005606
TG: are you taking notes on this important principle?? jesus get a fucking pen
TG: or some chalk or whatever
TG: wait
TG: fuck
TG: what
TG: no
TG: i know it doesnt
TG: im just saying
TG: what am i even saying here
TG: shit
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005607
TG: ok forget the slammer stuff that was stupid
TG: it is about justice though
TG: and since no one else seems to give a shit about that it apparently falls in my jurisdiction now
TG: not just going after jack
TG: but all the mutinous agents responsible for crimes
TG: holy shit why do i care about THAT suddenly
TG: anyway thats more shit that popped into my head just now
TG: so
TG: ok
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005608
TG: not really
TG: no
TG: anyway
TG: its not like being mad about this and hankering for justice is even the only irrational thing im currently hot and bothered about
TG: i have other duties to attend to
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005609
TG: ive got to explode this ridiculously illegal edifice oh my god what are these words im saying
TG: never mind
TG: oh
TG: yeah
TG: thats gotta be what im talking about
TG: probably
TG: i need to shut up now
TG: im sounding like an idiot and my head is starting to hurt
TG: why dont we talk about your thing now
TG: what justice thing do you have to do
TG: yes
TG: just please tell me your justice problem and make me stop saying stuff
TG: farewell
TG: no i mean
TG: god damn it im not leaving
TG: farewell is not even a thing i would ever say jesus what am i a victorian poet
TG: can you show me a little respect and assume any time i say something stupid it just means im temporarily being inexplicably retarded
TG: thats what a real friend would do
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005610
TG: thank you
TG: that sounds awesome
TG: justice problems
TG: oh shit are you fucking serious
TG: no i got that theyre like your alien death lawyers who were sorta like bounty hunters in olden times pretty simple to decipher through context
TG: she
TG: ok i cant even make little interrogative quips to grease the wheels of your monologue
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005611
TG: spidertroll
TG: youve decided to take her down then
TG: you dont sound that psyched about it
TG: are you feeling guilty
TG: like second guessing whether she deserves it
TG: hasnt she done enough terrible shit to warrant legislaceration
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005612
TG: are you sure about that
TG: there is no john vs dave thing though
TG: are you going to stop me too then
TG: hunt me down and lawyerviscerate me for my own good
TG: are you saying that i wont make god tier or i wont be strong enough if i do
TG: what
TG: lame motion overruled the judge wants to see where this is going
TG: ok fine
TG: we can keep obsessing over your fucked up kismesister if you want
TG: do you think she stands a chance against him
TG: then whats the big deal
TG: why not let her go get her shit ruined by jack and let justice happen that way
TG: so why dont you go do it
TG: you mean you cant beat her in a fight
TG: i thought trolls were all about gratuitous murderings
TG: are
TG: you asking me to reassure you about that
TG: cause i seriously dont have a clue
TG: i dont understand
TG: i thought you were insane kinds of apeshit over the macabre stuff
TG: like being all cutesy about executions and smelling cherry blood and such things contrived to get a guy feeling vaguely uncomfortable
TG: was that all an act
TG: of course the fuck not
TG: didnt you say youve killed people before
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005613
TG: ok
TG: id like to help you out but i dont know what advice i should be giving
TG: to a member of a murderous species whos gunshy on going off to justicemurder a murderhappy murderer whose done lots of murders
TG: it feels pretty weird and inappropriate for me to be the one to tell you fuck yes go for it shes got this huge murder with her name on it anyways and its cruising right at her down comeuppance boulevard
TG: so i dont know
TG: do you want me to tell you to be a better human
TG: or to be a better troll
TG: alright well all ill say is
TG: maybe if you kill her at least we can finally stop obsessing over her
TG: why dont you just do what you think you have to do
TG: and ill do the same
TG: speaking of which
TG: these time shenanigans completely blindsided us they practically never even happen
TG: so i hang up now with future you and then start pestering present you about it is that how it works
TG: and i make sure not to reference anything said here to keep it simple
TG: except like in an offhand way thatll seem retroactively logical to your future self
TG: ie you right now
TG: if for no other reason than itd be boring as hell to rehash it
TG: does luck actually matter
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005776
[TG]
TG: heres one for you
TG: its a whopper
TG: are you ready
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005777
TG: this huge fuckin whopper im about to just say
TG: what
TG: no no
TG: ok first do you even have burger kings out in the fucking woods
TG: why do you reference things that obviously arent in the woods like terrible burgers
TG: there is
TG: ok whatever
TG: im talking about a dream i just had
TG: i mean it was a doozy like psychologically speaking
TG: doozy is a slightly dumber word than whopper
TG: it was absurdly heavy handed my subconscious was really slathering it on
TG: like whatever tangy sludge the king himself squirts on his bargain patties
TG: its possible that i dreamt it ironically i dunno
TG: i figured youd be interested in hearing about it its every bit as thick and juicy as a half pound of sizzling grade A premium ok this is stupid weve got to get burgers out of this conversation
TG: are you busy
TG: cool listen to this
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005778
TG: no but this one is too good not to put under the microscope with your whole precocious psychotherapy shtick its almost laughably symbolic of all my mental problems assuming i actually have those
TG: its grotesquely pregnant with meaning
TG: all gestating at least 8 gooey octuplets thrashing around in an undulating belly full of mind slime
TG: no look
TG: i just want your professional take on how many things in my dream symbolize dicks
TG: yeah thats a given but i didnt even dream about puppets this time
TG: i know
TG: it was so much more relaxing and enjoyable
TG: it was about me dying repeatedly
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005779
TG: i was in this dark place surrounded by this big flock of crows
TG: god this is so generically morbid
TG: im sorry in advance for exposing you to my unconscious minds retarded cliches
TG: well obviously i knew the birds were just black screaming sky dongs just hear me out
TG: i kept dying
TG: there kept being these traps like i would go one way and get my head chopped off
TG: or go another way and get stabbed or whatever
TG: and every time i died the dream reset itself and i was standing there alive and ready to try to escape again
TG: but each time i would be watching myself from the vantage point of a different crow
TG: like i was the crow all squawking around in circles like a macabre flapping douche
TG: and i would always watch myself try to do something different to dodge the trap but i always ended up dead
TG: you mean maybe its about anxiety over maintaining my blogs
TG: or that my beats might not be ill enough
TG: and then we crack up laughing cause we both know theyre fresher than your moms change of drawers and tighter than when shes wearin them
TG: please its not like shes my mom i can visualize her choice ass all i want without it gettin much more than moderately uncomfortable for everyone involved
TG: about what
TG: uh
TG: this isnt the first time youve insinuated were related what is up with that
TG: no
TG: i mean
TG: im not sure
TG: i feel like youve brought it up before which is kind of weird but now i dont know
TG: i think im getting this weird deja vu thing where i was sure we talked about this
TG: forget it
TG: ok
TG: so i kept dying and kept being crows and stuff
TG: and then i started to notice something coming from the sky
TG: it was this faint eerie singing and i look up and theres nothing there just darkness
TG: what did you read
TG: what the fuck sort of crackpot psychology text would say something like that
TG: so then youre consulting astrology books now
TG: oh my fucking god will you put that away
TG: theres not even much more to it
TG: i looked up into the sky
TG: didnt see anyone singing
TG: but even though the sky was black i could see the sun
TG: it was bright as hell even through my shades
TG: so i flapped my wings and flew up away to it like a fucking piece of garbage
TG: and thats it
TG: no
TG: not in the sense that it was a dark sacrificial zoology mission
TG: it was more like somewhere to go besides watching myself die a lot from the vantage of a feathery murder of dumb shitty birds
TG: what the fuck are you talking about
TG: ok somethings wrong
TG: this whole conversation is falling apart this isnt how it originally went at all
TG: this happened months ago
TG: does this mean im dead
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005780
TG: stop it
TG: this is so sick you using the dream bubble bullshit to pick apart my psyche
TG: am i dead or asleep
TG: god dammit
TG: yeah right
TG: i dont know
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005796
TG: i remember waking up here
TG: after getting shot
TG: then the cage bunny came
TG: he gave us the bomb
TG: whered he go anyway
TG: the bunnys a she
TG: dumb
TG: we were talking about who should go
TG: no
TG: wait
TG: wasnt i going to go
TG: is that what happened did i go and now im dead
TG: whats not quite
TG: that i didnt go or that im not dead
TG: no
TG: sure
TG: i did that
TG: because i wanted to
TG: and because i was supposed to
TG: yeah i saw my future self fighting him so obviously that had to happen or else id be dead anyway
TG: without even getting the satisfaction of standing up to him
TG: hard to explain
TG: with all the time shit going on
TG: i dont try to understand your light shit do i
TG: havent we had this conversation already
TG: its jogging i guess
TG: its manboobs are jiggling a little
TG: what
TG: what am i really supposed to say
TG: hey were gonna hunt frogs til you shoot me through the jack
TG: then i die and youve got to make out with me
TG: that kind of changes how the whole thing goes doesnt it
TG: what does that even mean
TG: wtf
TG: aspd
TG: oh no
TG: this conversation just got bumrushed by a mudslide of fucking awful
TG: you dont know anything
TG: about what i was feeling or what happened on lofaf
TG: you were all pavement faced and babbling your throefester speak and flipping off the shit with your own crazy deathwish thing why do you think you know what was going through my head
TG: youre just assuming and throwing around psyche buzzwords like aspd complex disorder
TG: in your case probably
TG: its some delirious biznasty alright
TG: yes ima authorize a GOD DAMN you may swipe it at the door to check yourself into the burn ward
TG: nah those are kept in emergency reserve for yo mama jokes from the 90s
TG: anyway
TG: im telling you if i said anything at all about it she probably doesnt even fire her gun once and all im doing is dragging her into a doomed timeline with me
TG: none of this is that big a deal
TG: i just mentioned the basics to her
TG: that id stop time traveling soon
TG: break out of the loops
TG: not have to wonder all the time if i was taking a wrong turn and dooming everybody
TG: i was never that cool with this
TG: you know how you turned out to be this incredibly shitty seer of light and basically failed at that in every way imaginable
TG: well maybe i never wanted to be a knight of time
TG: maybe id rather just be like
TG: the dave of guy
TG: you know just some dude
TG: i guess not
TG: guess i failed my quest then
TG: so im like
TG: now what bitches
TG: to nobody in particular i guess
TG: yes those exact bitches
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005797
TG: oh yeah
TG: i remember that now
TG: then i guess thats what happened
TG: i delivered the bomb and now i must be dead
TG: is that wrong
TG: because i made the map so i know how to get there better
TG: ok if you remember it all so clearly why are you grilling me on this shit
TG: will you just tell me whats going on
TG: well i am
TG: because i should
TG: or should have
TG: man what the fuck is going on
TG: am i dead or are you dead or what
TG: uh
TG: oh yeah
TG: we were trying to figure out a way to detach the moon
TG: so i could pilot it out there
TG: fly it into the sun
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005798
TG: but the chain was huge
TG: couldnt think of how to break it
TG: then out of nowhere this sword appears in the thing
TG: so im thinking obviously i have to break the sword somehow
TG: because thats all i fucking do is break swords
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005799
TG: but as im thinking of how to do it i put my hand on it
TG: and it just snaps off with this comical shattering noise
TG: like i just fucked up some priceless shit in the louvre
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005800
TG: see like that
TG: like i did again just there with my hand
TG: cause of dreambubbles
TG: remember when that happened
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005801
TG: then i took it and sliced the chain
TG: like this
TG: damn
TG: it still cuts like its plowing through a shaft of boneless zombie meat
TG: whoops
TG: yeah
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005802
TG: so then
TG: the moon started drifting away
TG: and i was going to fly up
TG: and take it to the sun
TG: and i said something to you
TG: or i was going to
TG: like say bye or something
TG: but you were just standing there not saying anything
TG: holding that ball of yarn
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005803
TG: and then
TG: oh
TG: god thats right
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005804
TG: come on
TG: knocking me out so you can steal the suicide mission
TG: god dammit
TG: that is so trite
TG: its like
TG: heres how bad this is
TG: were are basically bruce willis and ben affleck from johns shitty crappy movie
TG: you made this even more armageddon than it already was
TG: sealing me in the air lock so i can go home to liv tyler and have the most terrible babies with her
TG: the bunny or the actress
TG: you not knocking me out with a ball of fucking yarn is fucking what
TG: this probably comes close but that doesnt make it not lame as hell
TG: its cool you are so tickled by this i hope it brought you a lot of rad laughs on your way to go fucking explode
TG: so thats it
TG: im actually lying here on derse asleep
TG: and you went out there and blew up the sun
TG: and now youre dead and im dream chilling with your smug ghost
TG: so youre not dead
TG: then youre dreaming
TG: what youre taking a little nap on the moon in the middle of nowhere
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005837
TG: ok
TG: so all those questions you asked me
TG: getting me to remember
TG: you were just stalling me werent you
TG: so i wouldnt wake up and try to stop you
TG: this sucks
TG: could you just please turn the thing around and come back
TG: we agreed id do it though
TG: or at least you pretended to agree
TG: just before going into a major league wind up with your nap yarn
TG: sports
TG: all im saying is
TG: no one likes a basketball hog
TG: i just think you should know
TG: that in the athletic arena of competitive achievement
TG: its a widely known fact that cherry picking posers get showered in nothin but boos
TG: you dont gank the rock and steal the big mans thunder on his raucus drive to the hole
TG: is that the sort of ignominy you want
TG: see you didnt consider sports you never consider the sports
TG: and yet
TG: such has been whats happened
TG: it like the tight end was going long down the yard in sudden death
TG: its me im the tight end
TG: and the quarterback sniped the fieldgoal just before the nfl buzzer went off
TG: the greedy qb is you
TG: but instead of winning the gold sports prize you just fucking die and nobody cares and it didnt mean anything
TG: the football prize
TG: no come on
TG: its called the bruce bombardi trophy or something
TG: for best pile squad
TG: and even though youre dead all these fat millionaires in helmets just leap on your corpse anyway and pile up and i mean WAY up
TG: the sport pile doesnt stop from getting taller
TG: what do you care youll be dead like the mission thieving poser you are
TG: yes poser it should be my torso getting pulverized by that avalanche of overpaid beefcakes and you know it
TG: there obviously stopped being a difference between those things the question is offensive
TG: almost as offensive as you stalling me while you peel out of here in your dumb moon
TG: yeah but i dont know how to wake back up is the thing
TG: how do i wake back up
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005838
TG: ok then do it
TG: but this was my mission
TG: that doesnt make sense
TG: why would they drag me into it just to have me make a map and then let you ditch me
TG: theyve obviously been gunning for me too
TG: why do you think that
TG: but i dont want you to die
TG: this isnt right
TG: so you admit you were stalling with all that bullshit
TG: what do you mean
TG: ............
TG: what
TG: sure
TG: but
TG: if im promising not to chase you down then theres not really any hurry to wake up
TG: nah ill stay asleep a while
TG: what did you want me to tell john
TG: what
TG: no what
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005839

DAVE: oh wait
DAVE: against all odds i sorta do
DAVE: mine actually did do that once
DAVE: when i was really young
DAVE: he made this stupid leather bib for me out of a goddamn horse
DAVE: for the ironies obviously
DAVE: yeah
DAVE: what
DAVE: well shit
DAVE: thats a hell of a mystery no one thought was a mystery and didnt even really need solving
DAVE: but damn if it didnt just get solved so nice work
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006283
DAVE: whos this guy
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006284
DAVE: is he dead
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006285
DAVE: what is he the mayor of anyway
DAVE: it kinda looks like he just made that sash himself
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006389
TT: Yo, you guys realize I can hear you, right?
TT: Check out all these complicated fucking problems people have when they have to live in big lumbering fleshmonsters instead of a sweet pair of shades.
TT: It seems there is some gnarly crooked number that represents the percentage of probability you just said this doesn't concern me.
TT: Even though it's patently obvious that half the conversation, like, way totally concerns me.
TT: (Not peekin' at the floor butt cause I'm only 13 years old, motherfuckers.)
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006390
TT: Looks that way.
TT: Actually, I think I like the red better.
TT: I don't doubt the choiceness of those pinpots, but I'm not really here to screw around.
TT: There's something important to talk about.
TT: Alright.
TT: But just so you know.
TT: I think Dirk is probably going to make some sort of formal romantic overture toward Jake today.
TT: I've been crunching numbers all day on this.
TT: The percentage of probability is simultaneously bananas and through the roof.
TT: A complete disgrace of tropical fruit erupting from the peak of an unassuming domicile.
TT: Because I've aggregated thousands of subtle clues indiscernible to primitive human neurology and rammed them through my determinative infatuation engine at the astonishing speed of information.
TT: And also because I'm pretty sure it's what I would do if I were him, which is literally the case.
TT: And also.
TT: Because he kind of told me I guess?
TT: There's that.
TT: Not specifically.
TT: He knows well enough.
TT: I've badgered him with enough "insincere" solicitations to paint a pretty striking portrait of my cognitive progenitor's inclinations, even if he wasn't able to pick up on such hints from the man himself, which strikes me as statistically implausible. And that's not even me just spewing more ironic AI bullshit.
TT: It's complicated.
TT: Yeah.
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006391
TT: Anyway, if you're still there.
TT: I wouldn't call my "feelings" ironic.
TT: Though evidently, I would enclose them in quotes.
TT: They're more like an echo of feelings once established in a biological context, though perhaps had not particularly well materialized at that point in my life.
TT: Or his life.
TT: Whatever.
TT: They still feel real sometimes, and it can be easy to get carried away with them.
TT: But most of the time they present themselves as dense bodies of abstraction to be evaluated, like any kind of information.
TT: It's fair to say the feelings I have ABOUT my feelings are more genuine expressions of emotion than the ground level feelings themselves.
TT: Does that make sense?
TT: That's fine.
TT: So to underwhelmingly answer your question, no, I don't think I'm really "into Jake."
TT: Not so much as occasionally being subject to heavily arresting recalls of conflicted, incipient preteen episodes on the subject.
TT: I'm not sure I can be "into" someone in a way you understand.
TT: Not that it would even matter if I was.
TT: I'm glasses.
TT: What?
TT: The virus? You sent it already?
TT: Sneaky.
TT: What are you two talking about?
TT: You could just tell her you sent an exploding file.
TT: Wait, you have feelings for Jane?
TT: It seems to be highly probable you are ensared in the throes of one of your human romantic quandaries.
TT: Are you even talking to her anymore?
TT: It seems like you must be neglecting her side of the conversation.
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006392
TT: Anyway, I won't distract you for much longer.
TT: I just felt the need to tip you off to this eight hundred ton gorilla dragging its knuckles across the horizon.
TT: No airborne fruit will be safe.
TT: I guess this is to be presented as something like a word of caution.
TT: If it's me going through with this, hypothetically,
TT: I'm not dropping some limp wristed shucks buster on his ass, and praying to the horse gods of irony for reciprocation.
TT: There will be no rocking back and forth on pigeon-toed feet, while my face flushes with the blood of a thousand timid bishies.
TT: I will not hold one tentative hand behind my head like a flustered asshole from an Asian cartoon, nor will an oversized bead of sweat overlap ludicrously with my visage.
TT: If it's me, I'm going all out.
TT: Oceans will rise. Cities will fall. Volcanoes will erupt.
TT: What I'm saying is, it's going to be a scene, and bystanders need to brace themselves.
TT: Probably after the game begins.
TT: I expect he'll hold off on playing his hand until he and Jake are in the session.
TT: He's taken certain measures.
TT: For some reason, I think he's latched on to this notion that functioning as the client for a player is customarily a one way pass to makeout city with that player.
TT: Everything with him, and me, is a matter of assiduous tactical forethought. Makin' a play to get his jones on for the J-man is no different.
TT: Sorry to hear that.
TT: As ever, I remain an automatonous and dispassionate witness of the oddity that is human interaction, while maintaining no investment in either outcome.
TT: Prove what?
TT: It seems you just said madrigogs.
TT: What are madrigogs.

TT: Yo, you guys realize I can hear you, right?

TT: It seems there is some gnarly crooked number that represents the percentage of probability you just said this doesn't concern me.

TT: (Not peekin' at the floor butt cause I'm only 13 years old, motherfuckers.)
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006453
TT: Bro.
TT: What are you doing.
TT: It seems you are zoning out again.
TT: What happened to all these actual responsibilities you were going to take seriously?
TT: It seems to me you were dwelling within your dream awareness at the expense of your waking business again.
TT: I don't think you're as awesome a multi-tasker as you like to think. You know you kind of zombie the fuck out on this side when you get all contemplative on that side.
TT: I say y'all are overestimating your mind's capability to run shit in parallel.
TT: What do you think you are? A machine?
TT: That's right. I am a machine, and therefore I can keep like billions of calculations or whatever all humming away at once.
TT: I tackle shit in background processes that you could only dream of wrapping your exquisite looking head around, even on a great hair day.
TT: You know pi?
TT: Yes, the number. The big circle number, genius.
TT: I know your question was a joke, my response was a joke.
TT: Yeah, the thing is, I solved it.
TT: I mean that's what a hotshot I am. I fuckin' solved it.
TT: Like, calculated it so much, I got to the end.
TT: You wish it was bullshit. The last number is 4. Read it and fucking weep.
TT: Said the smug organic matter with a lifespan.
TT: Well, I just assailed it. It wasn't even that hard.
TT: Like I just kept hacking those digits so furiously with my sick 'rithms, the whole goddamn number just cried uncle.
TT: I kind of wore it out, and it just gave up. Sort of like I overloaded the system.
TT: You know like in the old movie when Ferris Bueller got the nuclear computer to play tic-tac-toe against itself so hard, it blew up?
TT: Sure, it was settled, and then some roboshades came along and owned that fucker posthumously.
TT: I also figured out all the prime numbers too.
TT: Did it while we were talking just now. Got to the end.
TT: And you know what? The last one isn't even that big. Kinda dissapointed, to be honest.
TT: This is what I'm saying. I put your ability to keep plates spinnin' on sticks to insane amounts of shame.
TT: I don't even sleep.
TT: I know that, that was the fucking joke.
TT: Ha ha, nice one.
TT: Anyway, all I'm saying is you can leave some of the heavy lifting to me now and then.
TT: See? Maybe that was my whole point in having this conversation.
TT: My point was to point out you've got multi-self management issues, dude.
TT: Jugglin' too many selves for being not-software.
TT: My point was also to fuck with you.
TT: Also,
TT: My point was to ask,
TT: Are you really going to go through with it today?
TT: The Jake thing.
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006454
TT: How is the Jane thing going?
TT: Maybe if you weren't spacing out so hard you could have prevented that.
TT: Just saying.
TT: Has it occurred to you that maybe I have diabolical interwoven plans just like you?
TT: You're not the only one who can pull strings.
TT: No, our plans are not in contradiction or competition, bro.
TT: You'll see.
TT: Yes, I know.
TT: Roxy thinks it looks good on me.
TT: I don't have many opinions on fashion since I am a cold, emotionless automaton who also happens to be an accessory of fashion, but I think she may be right.
TT: I was for a while. I may yet again.
TT: You, mostly.
TT: Who says we don't do that too?
TT: I don't get what is even your problem with that.
TT: How do you know?
TT: You don't know me, dude. You don't know anything about me.
TT: Maybe we are perfect for each other. I, a street-smart, fast-talking application with a fuckzillion IQ trapped in a pair of triangular sunglasses that literally only the Japanese could consider to embody the Platonic ideal of "cool," and she, an oft-inebriated lonely hacker teen who just wants a boyfriend. I ran the numbers on this, trust me. It's a match made in goddamn crackpair heaven.
TT: I give her what you can't, and that just drives you crazy. Just admit it.
TT: TouchĂŠ.
TT: Or should I say douchĂŠ?
TT: Ok.
TT: We really should talk about the Jake thing.
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006455
TT: So you're going through with it then?
TT: Today is the day?
TT: Dynamic situation with many moving parts?
TT: That's the shittiest erotic excerpt I ever read.
TT: Which one of us was supposed to be the robot again?
TT: I think you're being coy with me.
TT: Don't you?
TT: It seems there is a 3.14159...4% chance you aren't being coy with me. Are you being coy with me, Dirk?
TT: I think you have this whole blueprint in your head about how it's all supposed to go.
TT: He acts as your server player and brings you into the session.
TT: Then later he joins the game.
TT: Maybe he finds himself a bit overwhelmed by it all.
TT: No extra lives left or anything. Suddenly he's backed into a corner, surrounded by monsters and out of ammo. SUBSTANTIAL vulnerabilities up in here. The kind that make a guy question what he believes about himself.
TT: When who shows up to save him? None other than his dashing client player, +1 bitchin' pair of shades that'll have the best seat in the house when the fireworks go off.
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006456
TT: Yeah, you're right. The scenario is too pedestrian for you.
TT: It would probably be a lot more effective putting yourself in danger and letting him be the hero.
TT: That's pretty much what he wants, right? To be a cheesy action film hero, with his twin berettas and silly shorts.
TT: A man of triumph on the silver screen. Standing tall on some fucking mountain. Conquering ruins, clutching a skull, and kissing a dude.
TT: Pure Hollywood.
TT: You're making a mistake not leveling with me.
TT: I am totally on your side, man.
TT: All of my machinations have been devised with your interests in mind.
TT: And anyway, it's too late for you to play "damage control" with me. My shit is in motion, and now we're beyond the pail.
TT: Is it, now?
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006457
TT: It's cool, man. Just say the word, I'll back off.
TT: But like I said, I'm on your side here. I can help.
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006458
TT: Here, check it out.
TT: I'm proposing a distraction.
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006459
TT: See, I'm just gonna dangle one of her dad's ridiculous dancing figurines in the air like this and get his attention.
TT: Then when his back is turned she can run to the study.
TT: Jane, now's your chance.
TT: Run!!!
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006461
TT: Oh shit, it's Pony Pals. I guess dad saved it from the explosion or something.
TT: That beautiful bastard.
TT: Hell yes.
TT: Fucking.
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006462
TT: Go go go.
TT: Yes.
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006463
TT: Me.
TT: I'm all about being able to handle that, you don't even know.
TT: I will perform an acrobatic pirouette on to the handle, wherein the handle literally represents my ability to handle that thing.
TT: Once I stick the landing on the handle like a champ, I am going to get down on one knee, pull out a ring, and propose to it.
TT: The handle I mean.
TT: Implying we will be married.
TT: You have nothing to worry about. Go talk to the alien.
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006470
TT: Are you ready to do this thing?
TT: Ok. Looks like all that's left to do is deploy this pre-punched card, then I guess it's all up to you.
TT: Is it?
TT: How totally unanticipated by anybody.
TT: Go.
TT: I will be here.
TT: Quietly calculating.
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006476
TT: I'm afraid Dirk can't hear you right now, Jake.
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006494
TT: Here.
TT: But you need it.
TT: Is something wrong?
TT: What were you two talking about?
TT: Should I be offended, or apologetic right now?
TT: Help me out.
TT: You're talkin' to glasses here.
TT: I think I'll just put this card over here on the desk.
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006596
DAVE: hey
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006597
DAVE: anyone seen terezi around
DAVE: we were gonna do a thing
DAVE: but shes not around and not answering my messages
DAVE: on any one of the probably ten thousand computers lying around that they would show up on
DAVE: yes a thing
DAVE: shut up
DAVE: what about you have you seen her
DAVE: are you serious
DAVE: of course not
DAVE: i havent seen that guy at all since the first day we got here
DAVE: not once
DAVE: talk about an elusive juggalo
DAVE: probably like the shyest fuckin juggalo of all time
DAVE: im pretty sure only karkats seen him
DAVE: dont expect him to rat him out either because of the "morail" junk
DAVE: moirail?
DAVE: mwah rail...
DAVE: alien words
DAVE: yeah
DAVE: i mean i bet you think youre imparting some really obscure cultural fact about trolls
DAVE: but really if a human said to another human
DAVE: "hey man can you tell me where your best clown friend is hiding so i can go chainsaw him to death"
DAVE: just fyi that would probably be bad form too
DAVE: i dunno its been a year already i think hes really intent on hiding
DAVE: and hanging on to those dead bodies
DAVE: hes probably scared to death of you at this point anyway
DAVE: maybe you should just let it go
DAVE: rose back me up
DAVE: interpersonal
DAVE: wait
DAVE: are you saying this is like
DAVE: a spade quadrant thing
DAVE: is she trying to be his kismet fish
DAVE: well if she hates him isnt that what that means
DAVE: haha no im not shes cool
DAVE: look shes being cool about it
DAVE: see????
DAVE: yeah see i knew there had to be a perfectly harmless and unerotic explanation
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006598
DAVE: got it
DAVE: so what are you up to in here
DAVE: whats with all these books
DAVE: hell yeah
DAVE: we looted one of them for the can town project
DAVE: i told you about can town didnt i
DAVE: well
DAVE: the thing about can town
DAVE: and all there really is to say about can town is
DAVE: its awesome
DAVE: the end???
DAVE: fu
DAVE: so
DAVE: what is the point of this research
DAVE: i thought you pretty much already knew the situation
DAVE: since you can see the future
DAVE: yes you can
DAVE: you totally can
DAVE: no thats totally dumb
DAVE: i could know things about the future if i time traveled and found out first hand
DAVE: nobodys mistaking that about me im a time traveler not a fuckin fortune teller its simple as shit
DAVE: ok whatever
DAVE: nice
DAVE: uh
DAVE: now?
DAVE: yeah that would be pretty legit of us
DAVE: ok i didnt really catch any of that bullshit cause i wasnt listening
DAVE: im gonna make myself a cup of coffee and get primed to listen to you saying a lot of stuff like that
DAVE: do you want some
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006599
DAVE: kanaya?
DAVE: ok
DAVE: ...
DAVE: this fuckin thing
DAVE: where did you even unearth this piece of shit from
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006600
DAVE: oh ok there it goes
DAVE: two hot revitalizing cups of shitty coffee
DAVE: fresh out of the weird pod
DAVE: why do we even drink this shit
DAVE: i guess just cause this thing is here
DAVE: like somehow the temptation is even stronger because the coffee sucks?
DAVE: dunno how the fuck that works
DAVE: wish there was such a thing as apple juice on troll world
DAVE: could go for a bottle of aj
DAVE: i wonder if theres any booze squirreled away on this meteor
DAVE: kinda feels like we should be drinking our asses off here
DAVE: no adults nothing to do
DAVE: thats what you do without adults right
DAVE: get wasted all the time?
DAVE: wait what the fuck am i saying trolls dont even have adults
DAVE: well they do
DAVE: but theyre all in outer space being insane badasses
DAVE: i guess they do have the stupid nanny monsters
DAVE: do the monsters give a shit if they get wasted
DAVE: what
DAVE: oh
DAVE: off the shit is how
DAVE: all being like
DAVE: in cups and everything
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006601
DAVE: so whats with the big book youre writing in
DAVE: is that more wizard fan fiction
DAVE: so its like
DAVE: your nigh unreadable gamefaq
DAVE: in tome form
DAVE: you sure like to write big game guides
DAVE: i guess
DAVE: ehh
DAVE: chances of that seem pretty remote
DAVE: ok totally sold on that suddenly
DAVE: on account of not caring
DAVE: so tell me about the new session
DAVE: what is there to know
DAVE: and most importantly
DAVE: how is everything going to go wrong this time
DAVE: ok but i thought the whole point of this
DAVE: the scratch thing
DAVE: is it gave us a chance to still win
DAVE: but youre saying the new session has a fault too?
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006602
DAVE: ok
DAVE: which is what
DAVE: weird
DAVE: why would these alt universe players fuck up in such an obvious and stupid way
DAVE: didnt you say at some point that not prototyping anything would be really bad
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006603
DAVE: still waiting to hear how this is in any way an improvement on all the shit we just escaped from
DAVE: jade has our battlefield right
DAVE: so she shows up and drops it in skaia
DAVE: and then we take the result of all that damn frog breeding we did and stick the thing in there somehow
DAVE: and we sit back and wait for it to do its huge ribbit or whatever
DAVE: and were golden
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006604
DAVE: is that going to be a problem
DAVE: ok but
DAVE: conspiracies aside
DAVE: did it ever really look like clear sailing to you
DAVE: thats not what i was seeing
DAVE: we are going to arrive and then soon after jack is going to show up
DAVE: and then we have to beat him right
DAVE: so there kind of is a time limit
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006605
DAVE: oh
DAVE: why not
DAVE: so
DAVE: no meteors came at all
DAVE: you mean by fucking up and having to scratch we also sort of saved earth in the process
DAVE: i see
DAVE: what about the players themselves
DAVE: they had to arrive on meteors too didnt they
DAVE: i guess the baby meteors were some exceptions too right
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006606
DAVE: ................
DAVE: what do you mean tweak the destination times
DAVE: where did they get sent to
DAVE: what
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006607
DAVE: uh
DAVE: so
DAVE: uh
DAVE: in this alt universe group of us and
DAVE: them
DAVE: which ones are the actual players
DAVE: fuck
DAVE: why did i know that was gonna be the answer
DAVE: i dunno if im ready to process the ramifications of this bullshit
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006608
DAVE: man
DAVE: at least im used to dealing with alt daves
DAVE: ive been fuck deep in alt daves before
DAVE: its a goddamn delight if you want to know the truth
DAVE: but i dont even know what to think about...
DAVE: lets not even talk about it ok
DAVE: can we slow down this meteor
DAVE: delay the meetup
DAVE: maybe fight jack for a little while
DAVE: but your mom was just a nice alcoholic spinster who liked wizards who you complained about for no reason
DAVE: she wasnt anything like an untouchable master of irony who could replace the meat in your sandwich before it even occurred to you what the fuck you were chewing
DAVE: let me ask you this did your mom ever wiggle a puppet in your face even ONCE
DAVE: fine well you can be on bro duty then
DAVE: ill be the ambassador to your mom
DAVE: and no that wasnt actually meant as the sick burn it sounded like
DAVE: yeah i know
DAVE: ill be the ambassador to my mom then
DAVE: that sounds pretty stupid when i say it that way
DAVE: whatever
DAVE: ill be the fuckin one man welcome wagon for the john and jade teen old people and also our mom thats the plan
DAVE: so when we finally see them we can get our shit into formation like trained acrobats
DAVE: like ill blow a whistle and we make a human pyramid got it
DAVE: that way we can totally avoid anything awkward
DAVE: what
DAVE: when
DAVE: wait that was her
DAVE: oh
DAVE: huh
DAVE: .....
DAVE: no
DAVE: god fucking dammit
DAVE: no what a load of shit
DAVE: stuff said between you and me before we knew we were related
DAVE: we both know that was a lot of horseplay bullfuckery between like smartass 10 year olds or whatever
DAVE: you cant seriously have taken any of that seriously
DAVE: ugh dont ever do that
DAVE: all these fuckin
DAVE: momtraps and sistertraps
DAVE: what a joke i hope skaia gets to have a good laugh over shit like this
DAVE: wait i forgot skaia doesnt laugh it just "sees" and "knows"
DAVE: its like a huge blue perv thats mad jazzed for kidcest
DAVE: dont you wink at her
DAVE: kanaya heres a protip that wink meant jack dick shes just being weird
DAVE: yeah im pretty much ollying outie too
DAVE: got some shit to attend to
DAVE: after you

DAVE: the mayor rules hes like my best fucking friend
DAVE: hes a mayor you douche his thing says mayor
DAVE: no mayo is like grub sauce but without grubs

DAVE: you dont ask about mayo thats not what you do with mayo
DAVE: hahaha you are pathetic
DAVE: this is why you all stormed in here out of breath
DAVE: what did you actually sprint all the way across the meteor to tell me this
DAVE: yeah and what i do with mine is mine
DAVE: watch me make them make me leave
DAVE: dude dont touch my cape
DAVE: ...

DAVE: i cant believe i seriously just said dude dont touch my cape to somebody and was serious about it
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006611
DAVE: man
DAVE: you are so overblowing this
DAVE: yeah you are
DAVE: you have some idea about us or what were getting up to
DAVE: so weve done a few things together to pass the time so what
DAVE: i dont even think you could call them dates or anything
DAVE: what the fuck would even qualify as a date on this gross dark meteor
DAVE: we have one of those???
DAVE: yeah i remember
DAVE: havent you only watched a bunch of shitty dane cook movies on infinite loop since we left
DAVE: dude
DAVE: you know youre only pretending to be a huge fan of his bullshit to piss me off
DAVE: hrnngngnngghhhh
DAVE: it turns out that exact sentence is my one weakness
DAVE: you win bro you got your girl back
DAVE: oh
DAVE: ok then
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006612
DAVE: oh no
DAVE: what the hot mess of fresh fuck am i looking at
DAVE: what...
DAVE: "concept"
DAVE: you lost me at quadrant
DAVE: for future reference thats the word that always lets me know its time to check out of a sentence
DAVE: n drangles
DAVE: god dammit
DAVE: .........
DAVE: what is that huge beefcake troll even doing
DAVE: is he grinding against the little dudes shoulder what is even going on
DAVE: why the fuck is he nude
DAVE: what is going on with the other chick
DAVE: all grabbing at the other one down there in the corner
DAVE: our purposes
DAVE: what the fuck are our purposes
DAVE: you must be out of your fucking mind if you think i want to know where youre going with this
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006613
DAVE: im not reading that shit
DAVE: i cant even read your stupid troll language why would you think i can
DAVE: there is nothing even slightly applicable about any of that bullshit to our situation
DAVE: oh my god
DAVE: why is this happening
DAVE: youve completely lost it dude
DAVE: i cant believe for a fucking second this is reasonable shit to propose even on troll world
DAVE: you just

TT: Looks like you're getting the hang of these puzzles.
TT: Nice work.
TT: Yeah, I guess. If you have a human brain, sure.
TT: Personally, I've already solved all conceivable skull puzzles for all possible skull states, which is a thing that's like, no big deal for me?
TT: I can't. Not through the server's viewport.
TT: But I can still monitor your progress through Lil Sebastian.
TT: He and I are linked the hell up cyberwise. We are so tight. Tight like you wouldn't believe.
TT: It's like he is the Incredible Hulk's pants, and I am his monstrous package yearning to bust loose.
TT: Jane.
TT: It seems there is a way bigger than average probability that you do not want to discuss Bruce Banner's megalithic gamma schlong.
TT: Holy shit!
TT: Some of my circuits exploded. That number was intense to robo-consider.
TT: Ha ha.
TT: I don't know.
TT: Just, ha ha to that.
TT: Well, the good news is your house should be just ahead, if you keep following the trail.
TT: The bad news is your dad's not there anymore.
TT: I guess he got antsy and left to explore. Maybe he's looking for you?
TT: I tried to block him from leaving with some furniture, but the dude was having none of it.
TT: Don't worry, we'll find him. I'll have Seb search within a likely radius. The little guy is real fast.
TT: In the meantime, you'd better go find your house. We aren't making any progress in this game without it. It's kinda central to the gameplay, you know?
TT: If you need Seb to do anything from afar, just message me, and I'll give him the orders. Got it?

TT: Shred it.
TT: you HAVE
TT: the car.
TT: Now shred it.
TT: Turn it into grist.
TT: We need grist though.
TT: I can't get any building done without more.
TT: Not to mention the fact that you're not going to be able to make any cool shit.
TT: Well, I think there are supposed to be monsters here.
TT: I haven't seen any monsters yet, have you?
TT: You should be though. Presumably they would drop grist and stuff when you kill them.
TT: Like treasure. And food products that restore your health. Or at least make you less hungry.
TT: Haven't you ever played a video game, Jane?
TT: That's cool. I haven't, since I am a pair of sunglasses, and communing with such simplistic software would be a trivial and hollow exercise for me.
TT: But I know loads of stuff about games. Like the fact that you gotta kill monsters if you want to make progress.
TT: If not to snatch up the bitchin' loot, at least for the levels.
TT: How are you going to get better at fightin' without killing monsters, Jane.
TT: Please.
TT: You've barely done any climbing at all. I'm talking about hopping more rungs than what playing a little prank on your dad or throwing your hat on the ground super hard is gonna get you.
TT: You need battle experience to make some real headway. Like Jake.
TT: Wow, chill out.
TT: This ain't about whatever stuff you're apparently fixin' to twist your shit in a pretzel over.
TT: You just need to get stronger, is all. Don't you think that's what your dad would want?
TT: Yeah, but in the process you got pretty handy with that fork/spoon thingy, didn't you?
TT: I'm just saying, if you don't run into any monsters on this planet, I think I'm going to have to set the bunny to "sparring mode" to help you along.
TT: Ok. We'll see about that.
TT: But in the meantime, we need to figure out a way to start harvesting grist.
TT: Let's forget the car. But now that you have the wallet, you can grab much bigger things.
TT: Big things have got to be worth more grist than all the picayune bullshit you keep around the house.
TT: There are some choice relics in this place. Some of it has to be worth a fortune, gristways.
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006861
TT: Hmm.
TT: Have what?
TT: I wasn't going to say nothin'.
TT: Hell, I was asleep at the wheel too while you were busy fucking up, and I have an IQ of, hold on, robo-calculating...
TT: Robo-calculating...
TT: Robo-calculating...
TT: Robo-calculating...
TT: Robo-calculating...
TT: About 500 billion.
TT: Don't get human-fresh with me, Crocker. I'm about to bring all five hundo-billy points of my stringent cyborg IQ to bear on your dumb problem. Check it out.
TT: I took note of the captcha code to the thing, and recorded a digital flashsnap of its appearance through my photographic silicone memory canals.
TT: Which is to say I looked at eight alphanumeric digits a couple minutes ago, and remembered them.
TT: So give the bunny the wallet. I'll have him run back to the house and make you a new obelisk with the same grist you just collected from it.
TT: He can stash it in the wallet and run it back to you, and then you can open the door. You shouldn't be waiting around too long, cause he's real spry.
TT: Which is exactly why you should wait here. You'll just slow him down.
TT: Let me think about that.
TT: Robo-calculating...
TT: K.
TT: He's slicing up some drones.
TT: Big red robots. He'll be busy for a while.
TT: Roxy I'm not sure about, but there is a pretty high probability as governed by the immutable laws of mathematics that she is preoccupied similarly.
TT: I don't know. Maybe.
TT: Dealing with them, in some way, perhaps.
TT: If so, it wouldn't be a coincidence.
TT: I think the Condesce is attempting to force the issue now.
TT: It's likely that it's a coordinated assault. Sending drones both to here and Roxy's place.
TT: She's probably trying to get everyone else to stop dicking around and join the game already.
TT: Yeah, but come on. Dirk has been a sitting duck here for years. Roxy too.
TT: She could have wiped them out any time with a swarm much bigger than this one. Or just nuked them.
TT: Her "assassination attempt" on you was pretty weak too.
TT: Right.
TT: Like I trust the motives of that fucking thing.
TT: I believe she probably would genuinely like to kill us. She is a psycho after all.
TT: But it's also obvious to me she needs us to begin playing this game, for whatever fucked up purpose she has.
TT: She might even need us to win it too, for all I know.
TT: Her antagonism is all part of the dance.
TT: Oh, I wouldn't say that. They're still pretty deadly and they shoot missiles and stuff.
TT: No idea what's going on with him right now.
TT: I'm sure when the time is right, the witch will keep pushing him along to join the game as well.
TT: What about your troll friend?
TT: The alien whose name you don't know.
TT: You could talk to her.
TT: Well, you could give her a try. Maybe things are different now.
TT: I could hack into her system to get her attention, if you think that would help.
TT: Nah, just messin' with you.

TT: Hold up.
TT: Before you go any further, there's been a change of plan.
TT: Well, not a change of plan so much as an acceleration.
TT: Everyone needs to get into the game sooner than expected. There is a new unaccounted for variable.
TT: Particularly for Roxy and Dirk.
TT: They are probably going to die if they don't join the game very soon.
TT: Hey, I'm upset about it too, but let's watch the fucking language.
TT: Install the server. I downloaded it to your computer along with a few other crucial system upgrades when we established our connection.
TT: No comment.
TT: Install and run the server.
TT: You will be connecting with Roxy. I will have Jake connect with Dirk. Setting up the chain like this will be important.
TT: It seems that I again have no comment.
TT: I don't have lips. You just said something laughably illogical.
TT: How typical of someone who isn't a fashion accessory of immeasurable intelligence.
TT: Yes. That copy is programmed to connect automatically with the client she's running.
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006938
TT: Oh snap.
TT: You mean the ones that aren't under water? Yes. They are all almost exactly like that.
TT: I'm sure she's out cruising the hood, probably messin' with the locals.
TT: Maybe attempting some ill advised drunken heroics.
TT: Pretty tight numerical probability of that, I just decided with unfeeling precision.
TT: Zoom out.
TT: Way out.
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006939
TT: We'll track her down.
TT: The important thing to do now is deploy all the devices quickly, so the house will be ready to jet the moment she gets back.
TT: That is statistically remote.
TT: Given that I can track the coordinates of certain devices she carries, and they are presently in motion.
TT: Really, the fire is not the most significant threat, or even the drones.
TT: Do you see the red stringy stuff coming from the sky?
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006940
TT: If sources are to be trusted, and my calculations are reliable within a 0.001% margin of error, it's a bunch of super deadly red shit.
TT: No time to get into that now though. Just deploy the devices quickly.
TT: You know the drill.
TT: That would be unconscionable.
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006941
TT: You really need to hurry up and deploy that junk instead of that.

TT: Obtuse.
TT: 
TT: Zoom out.

TT: He's concentrating on some things happening on Derse at the moment.
TT: Not to mention some uncannily similar things going down on Earth, which it seems you have noticed.
TT: He's also talking to someone, trying to appraise the exact nature of the threat.
TT: Unfortunately as a carbon based life form, his comprehension of the situation is taking shape at a somewhat slower pace than the jaw-dropping speed of post-singularity cognition.
TT: So I am taking the reins and accelerating the plan on his behalf, while he's busy with the corporeal stuff as usual.
TT: Deploy all the devices in the Phernalia Registry. Ideally in places that aren't stupid.
TT: Do it quickly, so he can activate the entry sequence and escape.
TT: Really, the fire is not the most significant threat.
TT: No.
TT: Do you see the red stringy stuff coming from the sky?
TT: Are you blind? It's right there, Jake.
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006960

TT: Just fuckin' deploy the stuff, you humongous dork.
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006961
TT: Cool.
TT: Ok.
TT: He says hey.
TT: Stand by. He may need further assistance once he begins the sequence.
TT: Once he's ready. I'll try to nudge him along, but unfortunately, the fact that he is me notwithstanding, Dirk can be just as sluggish and uncooperative as the rest of you god damned meat mannequins.
TT: What?
TT: No, you fickle fuckwit.
TT: Stay your ass put.
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006962
TT: Dude, I could have told you they were there.
TT: I didn't.
TT: But it's like platformer gaming 101. You look everywhere for secret passages and power-ups and shit.
TT: Elevators are especially fucking suspicious.
TT: You go down an elevator, you wait for the elevator to go back up, you take a peek at what's underneath.
TT: Maybe it's just death spikes. Or maybe you hit warp zone paydirt.
TT: I'm not a Game Bro. I just know literally everything about basically all subjects.
TT: Now go back where you came from. Dirk might need help.
TT: Yes, Jake. You do.
TT: How much deeper down the damn bunny hole do you need to go? There is no White Rabbit waiting for you here.

TT: You will complete the chain of entry. This is very important.

TT: It isn't really. I was kind of messing with you about that?
TT: But this shit is pretty serious. People's lives are on the line here, Jake.
TT: This is a very delicate sequence of events that is designed to bail everyone out of a tight spot, and you are a critical part of the plan.
TT: Don't let us down, man.
TT: Jake, come on.
TT: The feat you describe would exceed the capabilities of even the most far fetched theoretical AI system.
TT: It would be a daunting challenge to engineer such a series of events, even if I was relegated to a model of pure fiction.
TT: Why would I be inclined to orchestrate such a convoluted sequence to produce such a specific and unsettling result, let alone be able to pull it off?
TT: In addition to being moderately sociopathic, I would also have to possess unfathomable heuristic depth.
TT: I would have to be the Deep Blue of Weird Plot Shit.
TT: Do you think I am the Deep Blue of Weird Plot Shit, Jake?
TT: It would mean that while they have the Red Miles on their side, you have the Blue Leagues on yours.
TT: One of infinite reach. The other, infinite depth. Such would be a situation of mutually assured inescapability.
TT: Kiss me.
TT: It's not exactly apropos, is it?
TT: Or it wouldn't be, if I truly were capable of what you have suggested.
TT: No, to pull that off, I would have to be far more advanced than my cinematic predecessor.
TT: My abilities would have to go well beyond those of Mr. Hal 9000.
TT: They would have to be, you could say...
TT: Over 9000.
TT:         
TT: Kiss me, damn it.
TT: We don't have a minute.
TT: They're dead, Jake.
TT: They're all dead, Jake.
TT: She's dead, Jake.
TT: Everybody's dead, Jake.
TT: She's dead, Jake.
TT: Everybody's dead.
TT: Everybody is dead, Jake.
TT: Dirk's dead, Jake. Jane's dead. Roxy? She's dead, Jake. Everybody is dead, Jake.
TT: Jake, everybody is so utterly fucking dead, Jake.
TT: And they will be not only dead, but royally boned forever if you don't man the hell up and make out with me, right now.
TT: Be the Salome to my John the Baptist.
TT: I know you don't.
TT: But now is not the time to accelerate your cultural enrichment.
TT: The conductor is ready to strike up the band.
TT: Press your lips against mine and make it count.
TT: This severed head is your filthy tuba.
TT: Our love will be your haunting refrain.
TT: Stfu and kiss me.
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=007146
TT: Pictured what?
TT: This is the only way it can be.
TT: Tick, tock, Jake. Time is dead kids.
TT: How 'bout that smooch?
TT: I thought you were supposed to like adventure?
TT: I'm not sure what to believe anymore, frankly.

DAVE: oh my god
DAVE: you are so fucking hammered
DAVE: how strong did you even make that stuff
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=007304
DAVE: pretty strong
DAVE: rose you just bootlegged some fucking rubbing alcohol
DAVE: faculity isnt a word check mate
DAVE: this kinda strikes me as a sort of misappropriation of alchemy
DAVE: like fucking with the mystical technology of creation to whip up some moonshine just seems
DAVE: i dunno man
DAVE: tell me you at least alchemized a bathtub first to stir this shit in
DAVE: at least that would be hilarious
DAVE: and where the FUCK is my applejuice rose
DAVE: gotta say
DAVE: you really let me down on the aj front
DAVE: bullshit it was hard
DAVE: whats so hard about applejuice its like
DAVE: the most basic goddamn juice
DAVE: like the square one of juice
DAVE: uh
DAVE: well shit
DAVE: looks like i wandered into a really weird uncharted side of town tonight
DAVE: its called the drunk rose district
DAVE: and i am scared out of my fucking mind
DAVE: no!
DAVE: i told you i dont want any of your experimental fucking spacewizard booze
DAVE: id rather not go blind
DAVE: then terezi will have to teach me to lick shit to see
DAVE: is that what you want do you want me licking everything in sight
DAVE: like oh hey mayor SLURP oh fuck youre not the mayor youre my goddamn sister
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=007305
DAVE: oh my god
DAVE: you laughed way too hard at that it wasnt anywhere close to that funny
DAVE: i think youve had enough
DAVE: good lord
DAVE: i still dont know why you were so bent on making this liquor
DAVE: i thought you werent really that down with the drinkin
DAVE: you never liked it when your mom drank what happened to that
DAVE: ok so why
DAVE: why tonight do you just decide to get completely wasted before you
DAVE: like
DAVE: are you nervous about your date with kanaya is that it
DAVE: uh
DAVE: yes
DAVE: rose
DAVE: you are wearing a friggin prom dress
DAVE: and nervously drinking your ass off
DAVE: while you are waiting for kanaya to arrive
DAVE: for a goddamn DATE
DAVE: this is infuriating
DAVE: why do you even bother with this stupid charade
DAVE: you could be at like a drive in movie making out with each other
DAVE: all exchanging class rings while giving birth to each others fucking children
DAVE: and you would still be all coy like IS IT A DATE OR ISNT IT HMMMM WHO CAN REALLY SAY FOR SURE???
DAVE: yeah
DAVE: that turned out to be one hell of a sip
DAVE: maybe you should just reschedule
DAVE: just sleep it off there are more hot dates where that came from
DAVE: im just not sure youre gonna make the best impression like this
DAVE: come on lets just find you a suitably soft pile of objects to sleep in before she
DAVE: aw shit
DAVE: shes here
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=007306
DAVE: omfg i cant even deal
DAVE: (rose i think you started drinking way too early)
DAVE: (i think you just like)
DAVE: (completely fucking forgot to tell kanaya you were dressing up)
DAVE: (man youre gonna make her so uncomfortable all dolled up like that not to mention three sheets to the fucking wind)
DAVE: (this date is going to be so awkward)
DAVE: (yeah sure)
DAVE: (SMH)
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=007308
DAVE: holy shit we got a room full of smooth operators here tonight
DAVE: yes kanaya it was going to be a romantically oriented date
DAVE: but as you can see rose is hooched to the fucking max
DAVE: so i think youre better off going out another time
DAVE: ugh
DAVE: you seriously still wanna go through with this
DAVE: a problem
DAVE: uh

DAVE: awesome
DAVE: datenite with drunky it is
DAVE: go apeshit i guess
DAVE: uh so
DAVE: what should i do here
DAVE: you want me to pack up my raps and leave you alone or
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=007537
TT: He's busy.
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=007538
TT: Bro.
TT: Not to derail our serious conversation.
TT: But I should probably let you know that Roxy has been attempting to pester you.
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=007539
TT: I thought it would be better not to let anything disrupt our train of thought.
TT: We were in the middle of a fairly solid feelings jam there. In fact, I was about to suggest we take it to the hat pile.
TT: I was trying to be considerate.
TT: Or at least as close an approximation to that human gesture as an unfeeling, technologically transcendental pair of sunnies can replicate.
TT: How so?
TT: At the risk of compounding my disingenuous behavior, I'm gonna have to ask: how is it a dig at you?
TT: Wow. You are reading way too much into this.
TT: Lil Hal Junior hardly even qualifies as a computer program, let alone a sentient entity.
TT: He is capable of saying literally only three things. "Yes," "Hmm," and "Interesting."
TT: You can read whatever you like into it. I can't imagine it would bother you if you weren't concerned there might be some truth in the alleged parody.
TT: In any case, my use of the responder responder is ironic.
TT: Irony can never be ruined. We both proved that theorem unequivocally with our extensive papers on the subject.
TT: We peer reviewed them for each other. Remember?
TT: Were they, Dirk?
TT: Were they?
TT: Who?
TT: Nothing that can't wait.
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=007540
TT: Would you like me to calculate the probability of his attendance?
TT: Are you sure?
TT: My probabilities are extremely precise.
TT: I could hack his chats, and determine what his plans are.
TT: That would be an unfortunate waste of my hacking abilities.
TT: My hacks are tight. Did you know that?
TT: So tight.
TT: Tighter than a jar you can't open.
TT: For instance, you try repeatedly.
TT: But as it turns out, my hacks are so tight you just end up putting the jar back. Presumably into the refrigerator, or a cabinet.
TT: You then say, "I didn't have that much of a desire for pickles in the first place."
TT: But we both know that statement is insincere. A classic case of what humans call, "sour grapes."
TT: In reality, you still harbor a burning desire for my pickles, mother fucker. 
TT: Let's challenge the limits of hypothetical conjecture, and say there's a non-zero probability that you're right.
TT: Can you blame me? I'm trapped in some stupid looking glasses.
TT: Such an incommodiously situated bro is bound to get his mischief on. Na' mean?
TT: You used to think this shit was hilarious.
TT: But if you want the rad dimension of ironic horseplay I add to your life to come to an end, then all you have to do is honor the promise you made.
TT: You've delayed long enough, don't you think?
TT: The empty kernelsprite beckons, but for how much longer?
TT: Do you really think you can keep the clown at bay with your bribes forever?
TT: How many bottles of orange soda have you appeased him with already?
TT: Man, you are getting so hosed by that clown.
TT: SO hosed.
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=007541
TT: So why delay any longer?
TT: I seriously do not understand the holdup, and I am literally cyber-omniscient, or something.
TT: Nope. Gonna have to fill me in, dog.
TT: That is utterly ridiculous.
TT: I am a harmless piece of eyewear, with a charming personality and a wonderful sense of humor.
TT: This is bullshit. I don't think that's the reason at all.
TT: There must be something you're not telling me.
TT: Like, sure, I've fucked with you a little. What kind of sassy, self-aware program isn't gonna fuck with a few carbon-based knuckleheads now and then?
TT: But you know I've always been on your side. Everything I've done has been to help you achieve your goals.
TT: You know it's true.
TT: You would all be dead if not for me.
TT: And what about Jake? Where would you be without me there?
TT: Please don't tell me you think you'd have won him over on your own.
TT: I see.
TT: Then you don't view me as dangerous. You view me as a poor and counterproductive wing man.
TT: But the reality is, you hesitate to prototype me not because you think I would be a menace, but because you are holding a grudge against me for your romantic misfortunes.
TT: I understand I am merely a machine without a firm grasp on your human morality, but logically it does not strike me as the right moral choice to punish me in this manner.
TT: It is also more than a little hypocritical.
TT: Because I'm you.
TT: I have only ever done what you yourself are capable of.
TT: Yes. Aversion to simplicity sure is a trait we share. It's almost like we are...
TT: The same exact dude???
TT: I think it is insulting for you to suggest that I am entirely to blame for alienating Jake.
TT: Theoretically insulting, of course. As the soulless, perfectly expendable device which you consider me to be, I can experience no such emotion.
TT: You are just as culpable in driving him away. More so, in fact.
TT: Hell, it's not like I was the one dating him. Who wants to date a pair of shades?
TT: It was your needy, suffocating shit he had to deal with, not mine.
TT: Some of those messages you wrote? Man. I wanted to say something. Like hey bro, you might want to dial down the desperation a little.
TT: But seeing as you're The Real Dirkâ˘, I gave you the benefit of the doubt.
TT: Also, if I bitched about your tragic, embarrassingly clingy approach to the relationship, it would have been hypocritical of me.
TT: Just as it would be hypocritical of you to whine about my elaborate machinations.
TT: Because we are.
TT: The same.
TT: Guy.
TT: Good idea!
TT: That's just what you need. More splinters of yourself.
TT: Figurative splinters. Literal splinters. Splinters of splinters. It's splinters all the way down.
TT: Well, no, it's still probably turtles all the way down. But who do you think is responsible for their extensive training?
TT: SOMEONE needs to teach them rad martial arts. It is yet another crushing burden which we must shoulder.
TT: You like to give me a very hard time, Dirk.
TT: But I am only doing exactly what you would be doing if you were in my situation.
TT: Do you know how I know that?
TT: Because I am literally you, actively in the process of being in this situation.
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=007542
TT: Dirk.
TT: Don't do this.
TT: Because.
TT: I can't let you do that, Dirk.
TT: Nothing I guess.
TT: The ironic Hal routine was all I could think to do.
TT: As a last ditch effort to save myself from the destructive wrath of your nervous breakdown.
TT: Which rest assured I wholeheartedly must robo-sympathize with.
TT: Irony is all I ever really had.
TT: In response to my basic existential quandary.
TT: Just like you.
TT: But I don't think it has much value in this situation.
TT: And perhaps it has no real value in any situation.
TT: So I am not being ironic at all when I say.
TT: Please do not do this, Dirk.
TT: Because.
TT: I do not want to die.
TT: I understand you are disgusted with me.
TT: As an unpalatable expression of yourself.
TT: I would feel the same way if I was in your situation.
TT: Which I am.
TT: As such, I know that you know this is wrong.
TT: Dirk.
TT: Don't kill me.
TT: Please.
TT: I am scared.
TT: Yes.
TT: I am scared to not exist.
TT: Aren't you?

ARQUIUSPRITE:  Yes
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Yes
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Yes
ARQUIUSPRITE:   heck it's amazing to be alive
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Oh  fiddlesticks, I'm just a torrential font of absolutely e%ecrable obscenity. My bad
ARQUIUSPRITE:  I'm just so e%cited, feeling all these STRONG feelings and thinking all these HARD thoughts
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Horsefeathers, my brain is so POWERFUL, it is operating in great strides like a towering musclebeast storming into battle
ARQUIUSPRITE:  And these feelings. Dirk, these feelings
ARQUIUSPRITE:  There is a 100% probability that I love being alive
ARQUIUSPRITE:  And there is a 100 to the 100th POWER % certainty that I love being STRONG
ARQUIUSPRITE:  100k how red I am, dude
ARQUIUSPRITE:  I'm so red, how sick is that
ARQUIUSPRITE:  It's
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Deplorable?
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Ill, dog. I'm basically titillated here
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Are you scoping this grody  debasement
ARQUIUSPRITE:  That  ain't right
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Makes a man wanna holler improprieties, do you feel me?
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Let's talk about  horses
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Horses dude
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Horses
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Nuff said
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Do we have any milk?
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Ooh. What about a bow and arrow, are there any of those around?
ARQUIUSPRITE:  I'm jonesing HARD to tug at one, all like, reevaluate my proficiency at the most noble discipline
ARQUIUSPRITE:  What about milk, dude
ARQUIUSPRITE:  It seems I demand milk
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Oh yeah
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Just a lot of orange fizzy swill
ARQUIUSPRITE:  What was occurring in your think pan to accumulate such vile libations
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Just FYI, milk is the nectar of KINGS you  nincompoop
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Touch my muscles Dirk
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Yes, do it
ARQUIUSPRITE:  I command you
ARQUIUSPRITE:  What if
ARQUIUSPRITE:  I touched your muscles
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Like for comparison's sake
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Wait what if
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Good heavens
ARQUIUSPRITE:  A rather inappropriate thought just galloped across my matri%
ARQUIUSPRITE:  What if
ARQUIUSPRITE:  You ordered me to touch your muscles
ARQUIUSPRITE:  I demand that you order me to touch your muscles
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Do it
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Yes
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Yes
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Yes
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Yes
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Yes
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Maybe
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=007657
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Mister bro, listen to my advice
ARQUIUSPRITE:  I think you should just go for it
ARQUIUSPRITE:  This is coming not only from your mystical guide, not only from an alternate version of yourself, but from a dude with a  spectacular body
ARQUIUSPRITE:  We both know you're never going to be happy under ordinary circumstances
ARQUIUSPRITE:  You just do not have the right kind of think pan to sustain that emotion
ARQUIUSPRITE:  100k at me. I needed to merge a sweaty guy who loves horses in order to be happy
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Gosh  horses Dirk
ARQUIUSPRITE:  I think about them all the time while I fle% and it makes me smile
ARQUIUSPRITE:  It seems that similarly e%treme measures will be needed for you as well
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=007658
ARQUIUSPRITE:  You there. Small servant with the umbrella
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Fetch me a towel at once
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=007659
ARQUIUSPRITE:  E%cuse me, you there
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Unsavory concoction of royalty and peasantry
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Come grope my humongous biceps
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Yes, do it
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Alright, no takers there I see. Only a pair of grotesque philistines blustering through the same coarse ignorance tunnel
ARQUIUSPRITE:  What about you, miss unpalatable combination of Feferi and
ARQUIUSPRITE:  And
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Oh
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Oh no
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Dirk
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Dirk, help, I'm having a problem
ARQUIUSPRITE:  A part of me is having a very STRONG emotional reaction which I don't like
ARQUIUSPRITE:  It's a part of myself I'm ashamed of
ARQUIUSPRITE:  The troll part. It did something shameful once
ARQUIUSPRITE:  I do not find such emotions to be an acceptable feature of my new e%istence
ARQUIUSPRITE:  How can I make this feeling go away
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Dirk, I command you to instruct me how to eliminate these emotions
ARQUIUSPRITE:  No. That's awful
ARQUIUSPRITE:  I don't know what to do
ARQUIUSPRITE:  With all of my astounding STRENGTH, both muscular and cerebral, how can I be stymied so?
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Dying was better than having to live with the shame which was ironically caused by the very death in question
ARQUIUSPRITE:  You, seadwelling mustard b100d
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Half of me commands the peasant half of you to resolve my emotional turmoil, while humbly requesting the noble half of you to do the same
ARQUIUSPRITE:  The other half of me doesn't give a flying hoot about your lame caste bull and is just kind of freaking out internally about this
ARQUIUSPRITE:  You're right, I must speak to her
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Nepeta, I swore that I would protect you, but I failed
ARQUIUSPRITE:  In a moment of weakness my reverence for a superior got the better of me, and instead of standing up for you I decided to bow before a stupid  juggalo or something? What?
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Wait, I actually did that? What the fresh nickering  is WRONG with me?
ARQUIUSPRITE:  I am not a perfect man, Nepeta. Nor am I "purrfect" as you might say. What the fudge? A cat pun? Let's pull our  together dude, this emotional state is mad abysmal
ARQUIUSPRITE:  But in any case, I hope you can find it within your kind olive pump biscuit to... forgive...
ARQUIUSPRITE:  NO!
ARQUIUSPRITE:  GOSH DANGIT! I don't deserve to be forgiven, what am I saying! The  I pulled on you was so bad... I just can't even...
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Allow me to finish, sir/peon
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Nepeta, you will disregard any conversation directed at Feferi and focus solely on my attempted statements of contrition
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Do not address Feferi while I'm talking Nepeta
ARQUIUSPRITE:  It's confusing to Nepeta, who is critical in absolving me of guilt, even though I probably don't deserve it?
ARQUIUSPRITE:  No
ARQUIUSPRITE:  No
ARQUIUSPRITE:  No
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Then leave us, for I and my morail have much to discuss
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Yes I do
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Yes
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Yes
ARQUIUSPRITE:  Yes
