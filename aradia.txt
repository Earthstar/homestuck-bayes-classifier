AA: did y0u set up the teams
AA: yes
AA: i d0nt kn0w ab0ut that
AA: i d0nt kn0w ab0ut that either
AA: n0t really
AA: im 0k with it
AA: im 0k with a l0t 0f things
AA: even 0ur inevitable failure
AA: th0ugh it will briefly masquerade as vict0ry
AA: she was right ab0ut a l0t 0f things
AA: but y0u like t0 talk t0 me
AA: this a fact n0t a questi0n
AA: they t0ld me
AA: why d0 y0u like t0 talk t0 me
AA: ha
AA: ha

AA: what d0es anger feel like
AA: i f0rg0t
AA: maybe i never was
AA: i feel like i was th0ugh
AA: 0nce
AA: i think his anger serves a greater purp0se
AA: its part 0f his destiny and thus 0urs
AA: it will help him t0 sab0tage his 0wn designs
AA: which are very much in 0pp0siti0n t0 the br0ader purp0se
AA: and will s0w the seeds 0f 0ur failure
AA: a failure which will ir0nically pr0ve t0 be missi0n critical
AA: they never lied th0ugh
AA: this is h0w it had t0 be
AA: i have t0 be t0tally h0nest
AA: th0ugh at n0 p0int did i ever lie
AA: but thr0ugh 0missi0n
AA: this game will n0t save the w0rld
AA: and th0ugh it is still very imp0rtant even in 0ur defeat
AA: unf0rtantely it is much cl0ser t0 serving as the instrument 0f 0ur pe0ples demise than that 0f their salvati0n
AA: and we twelve will behave simultane0usly as the pawns and the 0rchestrat0rs of the great und0ing
AA: y0u will th0ugh
AA: it cann0t be st0pped
AA: mete0rs are en r0ute

FUTURE apocalypseArisen [FAA]
FAA
FAA: this private b0ard will and has already served as a l0g 0f past events f0r future selves t0 rec0rd and a guide 0f future events f0r past selves t0 f0ll0w
FAA: i d0nt kn0w which half 0f its r0le has been 0r will be m0re imp0rtant
FAA: p0ssibly neither is critical since deviati0n fr0m the c0urse is m0stly imp0ssible and reflecti0n 0n its traversal is c0mpletely irrelevant
FAA: but im typing this anyway
FAA: because im b0red again
PAST apocalypseArisen [PAA]
PAA: and here i was thinking we were finished taking 0rders fr0m v0ices!
PAA: weve 0nly swapped the imperatives 0f the dead with th0se 0f 0ur future selves
PAA: wh0 are als0 dead
FAA: yes it seems that way
PAA: 0h well it was an enj0yable reprieve fr0m fatalism while it lasted
PAA: id nearly managed t0 sav0r it
FAA: an err0r narr0wly av0ided then
FAA: i think we sh0uld refrain fr0m dial0gue in this mem0
FAA: with0ut res0rting t0 bannings 0r absurd exchanges 0f self repudiati0n
PAA: yeah i agree
PAA: i just th0ught id interject that and g0
FAA: 0k
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004491
FAA: we will and have already amassed an army t0 c0nfr0nt the black king
FAA: an army c0nsisting 0f 0ur alternate future selves
FAA: each 0ne rer0uted fr0m a d00med 0ffsh00t 0f the alpha timeline
FAA: each given an0ther chance at a c0nstructive influence 0ver the ultimate 0utc0me
FAA: by the way if y0u didnt kn0w already
FAA: a future self returning t0 the past fr0m a d00med timeline will always be slated f0r imminent destructi0n herself
FAA: its 0ne 0f the rules
FAA: and the unf0rtunate reality is
FAA: this will and has already been a mass suicide missi0n
FAA: 0r it w0uld be
FAA: and already w0uld have been
FAA: if we all werent already dead
FAA: 0_0
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004492
FAA: m0bilizing 0urselves in such numbers w0uld be required t0 neutralize the kings psychic attacks
FAA: it w0uld take 0ur c0mbined c0ncentrati0n t0 dampen the abilities he inherited fr0m glbg0lyb
FAA: with0ut the cumulative eff0rt 0f 0ur d00med reserves
FAA: with0ut the heightened mental and physical endurance 0f 0ur r0b0tic vessels
FAA: with0ut the untimely demise we all shared bef0re this began
FAA: vict0ry w0uld n0t be p0ssible
FAA: he w0uld kill us all with 0ne dreadful s0und
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004493
FAA: i d0nt kn0w if it was just bad luck
FAA: 0r an extensi0n 0f the curse karkat insists he br0ught 0n us
FAA: that lead t0 the incidental and unf0rtuit0us pr0t0typing 0f feferis p0werful lusus
FAA: with0ut which the battle w0uld have p0sed little challenge
FAA: i think
FAA: it was m0re likely just an0ther inevitability
FAA: a pr0duct 0f c0llusi0n between the disparate f0rces at play
FAA: a bargain struck between what skaia kn0ws already and what the g0ds demand up fr0nt
FAA: t0gether they 0rchestrate trials sufficient t0 ensure
FAA: that in 0verc0ming them we w0uld be pr0ven w0rthy
FAA: 0f inheriting
FAA: ribbit
FAA: wh00ps
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004494
FAA: and s0 it w0uld be and has been already
FAA: that while distracted by the c0mbined eff0rts 0f 0ur d00med legi0n
FAA: the king w0uld be aggressed by the 0thers
FAA: and even th0ugh each w0uld be well prepared
FAA: perched 0n the highest rungs 0f their echeladders
FAA: equipped with the best weap0nry grist c0uld build
FAA: versed in the deadliest fraym0tifs b00nd0llars c0uld buy
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004495
FAA: even th0ugh the mete0rs fr0m the kings 0wn reck0ning w0uld be turned against him
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004496
FAA: and even with 0ne imp0ssibly lucky r0ll 0f the dice at the final m0ment
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004497
FAA: we w0uld 0nly narr0wly succeed
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004498
FAA: but ultimately
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004499
FAA: we w0uld pr0ve 0ur w0rth
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004500
FAA: and the reward w0uld be within 0ur reach
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004501
FAA: but 0nly m0mentarily
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004502
FAA: bef0re we w0uld be able t0 claim it
FAA: we w0uld be interrupted
FAA: by s0mething
FAA: which w0uld be ushered int0 0ur sessi0n by a rift in parad0x space
FAA: a rift which we w0uld determine
FAA: will be 0pened by f0ur members 0f a fledgling species
FAA: wh0 will be playing in an0ther sessi0n 0f the same game that we will and have already played
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004503
FAA: their rift will lead t0 the great und0ing
FAA: with0ut necessarily causing it
FAA: n0t directly
FAA: such rifts are themselves supp0sedly benign
FAA: useful even
FAA: they are catal0gued phen0mena within the game itself
FAA: with a pr0vided means 0f creating them
FAA: and a wide range 0f scenari0s f0r which it might be prudent t0 d0 s0
FAA: the incipisphere l0cals have a m0re f0rmal term f0r them
FAA: they typically refer t0 such a rift as
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004504
FAA: a scratch
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004505
CAA: the direct effects 0f a scratch are limited t0 the sessi0n inv0king it
CAA: we w0uld n0t experience 0r 0bserve th0se effects fr0m 0ur sessi0n
CAA: but we w0uld experience the c0nsequences
CAA: in the f0rm 0f that which prevented us fr0m claiming 0ur reward
CAA: he wh0se hand w0uld be f0rced by the scratch
CAA: t0 emerge fr0m hiding
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004506
CAA: but there w0uld be n0 adequate way t0 prepare
CAA: even with all the f0resight at 0ur disp0sal
CAA: f0r a f0e m0re p0werful than the king we will and have already defeated
CAA: f0r a dem0n wh0 is indestructible
CAA: 0mnip0tent
CAA: and enraged
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004507
CAA: while the rest 0f the party w0uld absc0nd
CAA: 0ur duplicates w0uld buy us time
CAA: they w0uld all be killed
CAA: again

apocalypseArisen [AA]
AA: hello!
AA: i think its absurd i never introduced myself to you in all that time i spent moping around the lab
AA: guess i wasnt in a very good mood
AA: hi dave my names aradia
AA: um
AA: 6 a girl and a place very close to you
AA: in fact
AA: i could visit you right now if you would like
AA: to be fair it translates to the same age as you which at the moment is 12 is it not
AA: understanding disparities in the flow of time should be easy for people like us let alone understanding disparities in such pedestrian things as units
AA: i am 6 sweeps old one sweep is a little more than 2 years you dummy!
AA: look it is either the truth or i am just someone who is being a bit playful what is the harm in that
AA: :D
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005382
AA: i know you arent
AA: but i am
AA: maid of time
AA: whereas you are the knight of the very same cosmic faculty
AA: it would seem we have very little in common dave
AA: when in fact we have very much
AA: yes
AA: thats definitely what you did the first time we had this conversation
AA: so i will wait patiently while you realize thats not what youre going to do this time
AA: dave describe to me why you are now incredulous please
AA: of course you remember that
AA: this is a memory
AA: come to the window
AA: because im outside
AA: take a look
AA: that iiis
AA: becaaause
AA: im not out there anymore!
AA: turn around
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005383
AA: yeah
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005384
AA: try to remember
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005385
AA: are you sure
AA: why indeed!
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005386
AA: yes
AA: i think it looks pretty nice but go on
AA: no
AA: sorry
AA: not exactly
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005388
AA: yes
AA: yes and no
AA: yes and 2 nos!
AA: it is the afterlife
AA: but what is happening now is taking place in a bubble which is accessible to the living through dreams under the right conditions
AA: and it is also your memory
AA: the entry point for any bubble is always a memory
AA: either a memory of the dead
AA: or a memory of the living dreamer come to visit!
AA: but once you realize it is not just a memory
AA: what happens next is up to you
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005389
AA: no this actually did happen
AA: thats because it isnt your memory
AA: this is alpha dave
AA: the one who chose not to take the nap which led to your death
AA: did she
AA: didnt you ask for this
AA: evidently
AA: yes yes and yes
AA: yes it can be on the table and yes reality still means something
AA: and yes your guardian did die
AA: nothing
AA: all is well and as it should be
AA: what would you be doing there if you were him
AA: even better!
AA: would you be upset
AA: then maybe what you are doing is grieving
AA: in whatever way that comes naturally to you
AA: you are lucky to be able to
AA: i could not for a long time
AA: but now that i can again im so relieved
AA: because i have discovered there is no reason to grieve!
AA: looks like it
AA: who do you suspect you would be talking to in this situation
AA: maybe she is helping you through this
AA: you were helping her werent you
AA: i think so
AA: the living need each others help
AA: just like the dead do
AA: alpha dave still has a long way to go
AA: hes still not at ease with his mortality
AA: but people like us have to be!
AA: we have to be prepared to die a thousand deaths before our quest is complete
AA: the master we serve demands it
AA: pretty much
AA: they come here too
AA: in their own bubbles
AA: you may cross paths with them if you wish
AA: ha
AA: i know the feeling :)
AA: im not showing you im just visiting your bubble
AA: it projects your thoughts and memories
AA: as well as other things relevant to you much like the clouds do in skaia
AA: nothing
AA: none of this is your business anymore
AA: its time to move on
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005390
AA: oh look this was my hive!
AA: before it was destroyed
AA: what did you picture
AA: thats very silly and a little perverse
AA: but actually that sounds like what it might have been like on some parts of the planet sooo
AA: ill put in a good word with your bubble about it
AA: i dont know about hauntoffs
AA: but there is plenty of time to satisfy various curiosities you might have about existence and whatnot
AA: is it
AA: oh! yes
AA: there are all sorts of friends to meet
AA: ones you already know and ones you dont
AA: there is plenty of time for just about anything
AA: lots and lots of time
AA: enough time to understand that time isnt much of anything at all
AA: time is like a game
AA: just one fun game in realitys cupboard which is full of them
AA: its the one we are the best at!
AA: while other people are better at the other games
AA: but when all the games are back in the cupboard everyone is about the same
AA: and games are fun but sometimes you dont realize how much fun you were having until theyre all over
AA: and sometimes you look back and realize for some stupid reason you werent having any fun at all!
AA: then you laugh
AA: that laugh will suffice
AA: hey!
AA: want to see inside my hive
AA: it is quite possible and more than ok
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005391
AA: it seems you have a hiveguest dave
AA: tavros has been looking forward to meeting you
AA: yes you figured out the mystery!
AA: you may think so but then again you have not faced team charge in a match of slam poetry have you
AA: just kidding im no good at slam poetry haha sorry
AA: yes hes dead
AA: no i am wide awake
AA: and i physically stand before you in person!
AA: oh no
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005392
AA: i am very much alive
AA: and i intend to stay that way :)
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005490
apocalypseArisen [AA]
AA: s0llux!
AA: y0u will never guess what i just f0und
AA: i d0ubt it
AA: um
AA: yes
AA: h0w did y0u kn0w!
AA: yeah
AA: me t00
AA: what d0 y0u think it means?
AA: i d0nt kn0w maybe
AA: maybe y0urs are t00?
AA: wait
AA: yes
AA: shes very quiet th0ugh i cant tell what shes saying!
AA: g00d idea
AA: 0k d0 y0u remember what we talked ab0ut regarding kanayas ruins?
AA: i asked y0u f0r help in understanding the glyphs
AA: 0_0
AA: are y0u just being difficult 0r d0 y0u really n0t remember
AA: well 0bvi0usly!
AA: but i really appreciate y0ur help anyway
AA: well y0u said that y0ud need an0ther set 0f glyphs t0 make sense 0f them
AA: y0u speculated that there might be an0ther set 0f ruins
AA: y0u even guessed they w0uld be blue! it turns 0ut y0u were right
AA: d0nt y0u think that is pretty c00l?
AA: but y0u say that ab0ut everything!
AA: n0 its n0t!
AA: i did find s0me 0ther neat things d0wn here t00 which are strange but quite harmless and n0t f0reb0ding in the least!
AA: like this AMAZING hat!
AA: it is an authentic arche0l0gists hat its s0 hard t0 find them in this style
AA: there are n0 h0rn h0les but i l0ve it anyway its great
AA: i wasnt g0ing t0 tell y0u ab0ut that!
AA: damn it h0w did y0u kn0w
AA: this is stupid
AA: maybe
AA: well
AA: 0k
apocalypseArisen [AA]
apocalypseArisen [AA]
AA: ahem
AA: sorry to interrupt i wanted to give you both the chance to remember but it doesnt look like this is going anywhere!
AA: w0w what
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005491
AA: is it coming back yet
AA: thats right!
AA: nope!
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005492
AA: you are just asleep
AA: you are also blind!
AA: yes thats what being blind means
AA: sollux will you shut up and stop being so tragic for once
AA: you knew this was going to happen! your prophecies of personal doom were practically all you ever talked about
AA: i think you were looking forward to this honestly
AA: great!
AA: you should be able to relax now that youve been released from the curse of your vision twofold just like you said youd be
AA: you are now merely doomed!
AA: thats the spirit hahaha
AA: nope :)
AA: hahahahaha!
AA: i
AA: dont know?
AA: what noise?
AA: oh its jade!
AA: shes one of the humans we met after you died
AA: thats fine youll catch up!
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005493
AA: no dont!
AA: sollux try to be polite
AA: there is no reason at all for you to feel hostile toward them anymore
AA: jade is very nice and she did nothing wrong
AA: none of them did so when you wake up maybe you should try to reconcile with them or at the very least just say hello
AA: did i what
AA: well no
AA: but i should have!
AA: i did with you before i left didnt i
AA: shush you!
AA: it is!
AA: ill get you up to speed i promise but guys come on lets not scare away our guest
AA: oh my god shut up!
AA: no jade its ok
AA: please stay! im curious about why you are here
AA: navigating between bubbles is difficult here
AA: its better to drift between them naturally as they intersect
AA: not spatially but through common points in memory
AA: to navigate the furthest ring you need to have mastered the flow of time!
AA: that is why i am here
AA: i am alive again so i may assist the dead in this way
AA: jade tell me
AA: have you seen me here before? i mean me dressed like i am now wearing my godhood
AA: im wearing a hood and have butterfly wings what else would you like to know
AA: yes sollux that would probably be pretty weird
AA: thank you your outfit is quite spiffy too
AA: i like that skirt a lot especially
AA: is
AA: is that a skirt?
AA: shhh!
AA: yes ok
AA: you see those encounters you had with me before have not happened for me yet because ive only just arrived
AA: time follows strange paths here as does space
AA: if you travel a great enough distance you may discover you are also traveling either backwards or forwards in time as well!
AA: just as if you stay in one place for too long the geometry of space surrounding you will become unreliable
AA: you may swat the air to your left and discover you have just slapped yourself!
AA: the only way to make sense of it is to understand either property very well
AA: and since i am new here i have some learning to do just like everyone else
AA: but i do know one thing
AA: i knew that the first bubble i would enter would be an important one for us to visit
AA: hang on
AA: we are moving on to a new memory hold that thought
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005494
AA: it is important because it will help us begin to understand why we are all here
AA: no no
AA: not why we are in this bubble now
AA: but why we all exist in the first place and why we all went on this adventure together
AA: there is much to understand and i believe it all begins with one sequence of events
AA: watching will help those whove passed to understand the purpose of their sacrifice and those still living to understand what must be done to complete the journey still ahead
AA: we will let the memories lead the way
AA: are you guys ready?
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005495
AA: ok lets allow the next memory to take shape
AA: i believe it is kanayas
AA: i will reprise my role in a conversation i had with her shortly after i discovered the ruins
AA: everybody hide and try not to spoil it for her until she remembers!
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005496
AA: hey kanaya
AA: there is s0mething i want t0 give y0u
AA: yes its s0mething very 0dd i f0und when i disc0vered the ruins the 0ther night
AA: i d0nt kn0w what its arche0l0gical significance is yet but i suspect y0u will be able t0 repair it!
AA: 0_0
AA: w0w!
AA: uh i mean
AA: o_o
AA: wow
AA: you figured that out very fast!
AA: oh i am sure you are alive
AA: you are unconscious now and will likely wake up as your new self very soon
AA: yes
AA: you are undergoing a metamorphosis which you have been groomed for since you were very young
AA: much like i was for my various personal iterations including this one
AA: yes!
AA: but it sure sounds silly when you list them all like that
AA: wellllll
AA: that is what we are about to find out!
AA: if you will oblige us by continuing with this memory
AA: why dont we go through this conversation again to the best of our recollection
AA: but i guess rather than acting it out we can just talk about it
AA: the old fashioned way
AA: i have no idea
AA: haha yeah you know what i mean though
AA: yes
AA: i then had sollux deliver the pieces to you so you could stitch it back up
AA: sollux that is your cue!
AA: come out and play the part
AA: no of course not!
AA: obviously the jig is up everyone can come out now
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005497
AA: no guys come on this isnt that complicated!
AA: we are just revisiting the past just like we would if we were talking about it
AA: but it just so happens we can watch it happen as we talk about it
AA: and as a matter of fact
AA: this story does involve a role playing game but not in that way!
AA: youre stupid and you sound stupid!
AA: i dont know o_o
AA: but you maaay be waking up soon
AA: maybe not if we hurry this along!
AA: thollux is right
AA: i mean sollux
AA: kanaya tell us what happened next!
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005498
AA: yes
AA: not really!
AA: yes
AA: this is only a piece of the story
AA: the other pieces will fall into place with successive memories and it will all become clear
AA: but yes alright i will eliminate some suspense and try to serve as a better guide on this tour through the catacombs of our collective subconscious
AA: the separate tunnels we once traveled in the dark as individuals we now retrace together with a torch
AA: on the walls we illuminate the runes which describe a convoluted origin story
AA: an origin we participated in
AA: we were spurred to these actions by that which was being originated
AA: and incited to acts of revenge as we were turned against each other
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005499
AA: no
AA: our manipulator disguised his tracks well
AA: no tavros you can get up
AA: we will leave it soon
AA: but you were doing something very important here
AA: writing a part of the code
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005500
AA: an incomplete fragment consisting of four symbols
AA: comprising the first word of a binary refrain
AA: a pair of sounds emerging from the belly of a fabled tyrants menace
AA: but you authored only one sound of the pair
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005501
AA: i would write the other
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005502
AA: in the soot of my ruined hive i scrawled my part of the code
AA: completing the phrase of legend
AA: the persisting sounds said to accompany the ultimate demise of the tyrant less an arm and an eye
AA: but even these eight characters
AA: the scrawlings of charge
AA: were still but half the code
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005503
AA: there was another half by scourge in two parts
AA: one part three symbols
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005504
AA: and the other
AA: five
AA: why the scale was tipped in this way between sisters
AA: i cannot say!
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005505
AA: each fragment would be transcribed in our rulebooks
AA: sealing the collaboration between rust bloods and blue bloods
AA: completing the code for our sessions architect
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005506
AA: oh?
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005510
AA: yes we all lost track of our books
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005511
AA: they were gathered surreptitiously by agents assigned to the task
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005512
AA: and in the veil their codes were merged with the ghost imprints of other mysterious artifacts
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005513
AA: our first guardian was brought to life on the seed to pass through skaias final gate of defense
AA: the first to find alternia
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005898
AA: hey what are you doing out here!
AA: out of your bubble
AA: i just didnt think you could
AA: i guess you must have a foot on either side
AA: cant say im surprised!
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005899
AA: i am waiting for friends to arrive
AA: they will need my help
AA: no theyre alive
AA: first
AA: there will be two humans
AA: they should be joining us any minute
AA: then rest of our party
AA: the survivors
AA: yes
AA: well
AA: they made it
AA: your body will arrive with them
AA: along with the others
AA: hey maybe we can have a funeral!
AA: kind of like
AA: a big corpse party
AA: the humans could probably explain it better than me
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005900
AA: you can see the sun?
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006249
ARADIA: you see??
ARADIA: i told you they would bring your body
ARADIA: oh!!!
ARADIA: sollux lets do it!
ARADIA: the corpse party!
ARADIA: theres no better time and there are so many corpses here to work with
ARADIA: is everybody ok with that? do you want to have a big corpse party?
ARADIA: we can incinerate the remains in the sun it will be just glorious
ARADIA: rose!
ARADIA: can you please explain to my friends what a human funeral is like?
ARADIA: i couldnt have put it better myself
ARADIA: could you go into more detail?
ARADIA: hmmm that sounds just a tad specific
ARADIA: we may have to adapt the proceedings to be a little more
ARADIA: i dunno
ARADIA: multicultural i guess?
ARADIA: why dont you all do some brainstorming about what kind of funeral to have while i go round up the bodies!
ARADIA: whats the matter?
ARADIA: um
ARADIA: i just thought it would be a nice thing to bond over
ARADIA: am i really that bad?
ARADIA: oh
ARADIA: sorry
ARADIA: i guess ive spent enough time here that i just dont see death as the terrible thing the living make it out to be
ARADIA: i honestly feel like its a reason to celebrate!
ARADIA: death fan girl thing?
ARADIA: what do you mean
ARADIA: you think so?
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006250
ARADIA: the sun will never be destroyed karkat
ARADIA: im sorry but you were misinformed!
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006254
ARADIA: karkat i dont know if anyone cares about formal ranks like that anymore
ARADIA: or if anyone ever did!
ARADIA: but for what its worth i suggest that from now on you all listen closely to the advice of our human guests
ARADIA: yes!
ARADIA: no need to be so modest dave
ARADIA: tactically speaking a knight of time and a seer of light is a nearly unbeatable combination
ARADIA: yes you are off to an excellent start as a subordinate
ARADIA: keep doing that!
ARADIA: but dave dont worry if you do not have instructions for us
ARADIA: the knight of time is not necessarily the tactician
ARADIA: he is a powerful warrior class which exploits the flow of time as a weapon
ARADIA: rose is the one who must play the role of the strategist
ARADIA: the seer class knows her aspect comprehensively
ARADIA: as a knower of all fortune she can see the circuitous path that will lead to the most favorable outcome for everyone
ARADIA: personally i would defer to her judgment!
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006255
ARADIA: this is why you all needed an advanced seer!
ARADIA: i have become familiar with the ways of the fabric out here but even i couldnt chart a journey that long or complex
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006256
ARADIA: karkat go back to holding your breath!
ARADIA: this is going to be a wonderful adventure for everyone
ARADIA: im a bit jealous honestly!
ARADIA: or i would be if i wasnt having such a good time with my death fangirl thing :p
ARADIA: no
ARADIA: i still have important work to do here
ARADIA: but that doesnt rule out the possibility we could meet again in bubbles along your journey!
ARADIA: but kanaya you still have important work to finish too!
ARADIA: we cant ignore our duties
ARADIA: our race is extinct remember
ARADIA: and after a few more casualties it is now hanging by a thread
ARADIA: your job was to see to the resurrection of our people
ARADIA: theres always hope though!
ARADIA: you just never know and i dont think you should give up
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006257
ARADIA: oh nooo :(
http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006285
ARADIA: i can help with that!
ARADIA: sollux do you think you can lend me a hand?
ARADIA: theyll need the biggest push we can give them
ARADIA: ok you guys can keep arguing if you like but im going to send you on your way now
ARADIA: then after you leave i should be able to buy you a little more time
ARADIA: when jack comes ill slow him down for a while
ARADIA: it wont be for very long but its the best i can do!
ARADIA: youre welcome!
ARADIA: are you ready sollux?
